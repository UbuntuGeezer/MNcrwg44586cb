<h3 id=0.1>0.1 StreetNames.db Structure.</h3>

<p>The /DB-Dev/Streetnames.db is a database of all street names within the
territory. It is built from a file-by-file scan of all of the RefuSA
publisher territory databases, selecting distinct street names. It should
be noted that for letter-writing territories the street names include
the zip code.<br>
<strong>Streets Table.</strong><br>The "Streets" table is defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
    CREATE TABLE Streets(
    StreetName TEXT, TerrID TEXT, RUSpec TEXT, SCSpec TEXT)

    StreetName = extracted street name (may include zip code)
    TerrID = territory ID street is in
    RUSpec = RefUSA/Special/<db-name> containing street
    SCSpec = SCPA/Special/<db-name> containing street
</code></pre>

<p>No fields within the table have UNIQUE values. A street name may reside
in several territories, and several RU/Special or SC/Special databases.</p>
