<h2>Project Description.</h2>

<p>FixMakes is a "reliability" mod project that goes through a folder's
<em>Make</em> files and tidies up <em>path</em> variable definitions. The single build
uses <em>sed</em>, <em>awk</em> and <em>cat</em> to modify the <em>Make</em> file in the specified
folder (typically a Geany project folder). </p>

<p>The project will also be used when creating new congregation Territory
systems. There are over 1,000 makefiles within a Territory system, many
of which have path dependencies on the <em>folderbase</em>, <em>basepath</em> and
<em>congterr</em> environment variables. Whenever these system-wide environment
variables are changed, the downstream makefiles and shell files will be
affected. FixMakes, especially the FixAllMakes shell, facilitates rapidly
editing all affected makefiles.</p>

<p>The <em>Make</em> file header is modified with the automated revision date. The
makefile body is modified to ensure that the vars <em>folderbase</em>, <em>pathbase</em>,
and <em>AWK</em> are defined for the makefile. All of the vars of the pattern
"..path" are modified to ensure that they have no trailing '/'. All path
references "\$(folderbase)/Territories" are changed to reference <em>pathbase</em>
in place of "\$(folderbase)/Territories". All path references (..path) are
guaranteed to be followed by '/'.</p>

<p><strong>sed operations</strong><br>
The header of the <em>Make</em> file has a new line inserted from the file
<em>sedfixMake1.txt</em> file. This contains the automated modification date. To
avoid modifying the same file twice (and ruining the previous mods) the
file header is checked for the automated modification date being present.</p>

<p>All makefile path var definitions  of the form "..path =" that are ended
with '/' are modified to drop the trailing '/'. Then all path vars that
are referenced with "..path)" have a '/' appended to the reference.
This edits the makefile definitions and references of ..path vars to
be consistent.</p>

<p>In addition, at line 2 of the makefile a "date modified" line is added
for future reference.</p>

<p>After the first <em>awk</em> operation, <em>sed</em> is used to remove the "ifndef"
and "ifeq" conditionals in the last 2 lines of the extraction file.</p>

<p><strong>awk operations</strong><br>
The <em>awk</em> (mawk) utility is used to break the <em>Make</em> file into two segments
for rebuilding into the final makefile. The first segment contains all of 
the lines up to the beginning of the "if" conditional defining <em>folderbase</em>.
(It assumes that a <em>folderbase</em> definition is present). The second segment
contains all of the lines from the .PHONY directive to the end of the file.
(It depends upon ".PHONY" being present in the <em>Make</em> file). If the .PHONY
directive is not in the file when FixMake begins, it inserts it so that the
utility may continue.</p>

<p><strong>cat operations</strong><br>
After the <em>Make</em> file has been split and modified by <em>sed</em> and <em>awk</em>, the
pieces are rejoined using the <em>cat</em> utility. The original file is preserved
as <em>makefile</em>.back with the modified file assuming the name <em>makefile</em>.</p>
