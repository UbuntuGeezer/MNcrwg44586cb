Rclone is a command line program to sync files and directories to and
from various cloud storage systems, such as:

  * Google Drive
  * Amazon S3
  * Openstack Swift / Rackspace cloud files / Memset Memstore
  * Dropbox
  * Google Cloud Storage
  * Amazon Drive
  * Microsoft One Drive
  * Hubic
  * Backblaze B2
  * Yandex Disk
  * The local filesystem

Features

  * MD5/SHA1 hashes checked at all times for file integrity
  * Timestamps preserved on files
  * Partial syncs supported on a whole file basis
  * Copy mode to just copy new/changed files
  * Sync (one way) mode to make a directory identical
  * Check mode to check for file hash equality
  * Can sync to and from network, eg two different cloud accounts
