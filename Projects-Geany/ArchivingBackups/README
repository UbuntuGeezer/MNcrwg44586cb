Project Description.
--------------------
The ArchivingBackups project is a central information point regarding
the file archiving and backup provisions. Currently there is no "make"
file. Information regarding specific system backups is found in the
following files:

	README-Projects - documentation on backups of Projects in GitHub
	  folders to flash drives.
	  
	README-Territories - documentation on backups of Territories project
	  files and databases.
	  
	README-System - documentation on backups of ubuntu system for
	  improved system recovery if Windows HDD fails.

Dependencies.
-------------
The incremental dump shell utilities are dependent upon the following:

	Territories/log/Rawlevel.txt - text file with numeric level of current
		incrmental RawData.level.tar to be created. If this file does not
		exist it will be initialized with "0" and a full dump will be
		performed.

	Territories/log/TDlevel.txt - text file with numeric level of current
		incremental TerrData.level.tar to be created. If this file does
		not exist it will be initialized with "0" and a full dump will
		be performed. (recorded as TerrData.0.tar

	Territories/log/RawData.snar-cycle - --listed-incremental snapshot
	    archive information for RawData.level.tar incremental dump.
	
	Territories/log/TerrData.snar-cycle - --listed-incremental snapshot
		archive information for TerrData.level.tar incremental dump.


Shell Utility Files.
--------------------
IncDumpRawData.sh - perform incremental dump of Territories/RawData folders
  to uncompressed RawData.cycle.tar, where cycle taken from file
  Territories/Rawlevel.txt.

IncDumpRURaw.sh - perform incremental dump of Territories/RawData/RefUSA folders
  to uncompressed RawDataRU.cycle.tar, where cycle taken from file
  Territories/RawRUlevel.txt.

IncDumpSCRaw.sh - perform incremental dump of Territories/RawData/SCPA folders
  to uncompressed RawDataSC.cycle.tar, where cycle taken from file
  Territories/RawRUlevel.txt.

IncDumpTerrData.sh - perform incrmental dump of Territories/TerrData folders
  to uncompressed TerrData.cycle.tar where cycle taken from file
  Territories/TDlevel.txt.

IncDumpRelease.sh - perform incrmental dump of Territories/ReleasData folders
  to uncompressed TerrData.cycle.tar where cycle taken from file
  Territories/TDlevel.txt.
	  
TerrFullData.sh - perform full dump of both RawData and TerrData folder
  paths; uses ./tarxcptlist.txt as exceptions list of patterns to ignore.

RestartIncRawData.sh - restart fresh incremental dump archive of RawData
  by removing Territories/log/Rawlevel.txt; also removes all
  Territories/RawData.cycle.tar files to start fresh (after warning).

RestartIncRURaw.sh - restart fresh incremental dump archive of RawData/RefUSA
  by removing Territories/log/RawRUlevel.txt; also removes all
  Territories/RawDataRU.cycle.tar files to start fresh (after warning).

RestartIncSCRaw.sh - restart fresh incremental dump archive of RawData/SCPA
  by removing Territories/log/RawSClevel.txt; also removes all
  Territories/RawDataSC.cycle.tar files to start fresh (after warning).

RestartIncTerrData.sh - restart fresh incrmental dump archive of TerrData
  by removing Territories/log/TDlevel.txt; also removes all 
  Territories/TerrData.cycle.tar file to start fresh (after warning).

RestartIncRelease.sh - restart fresh incremental dump archive of ReleaseData
  by removing Territories/log/Releaselevel.txt; also removes all
  Territories/Release.cycle.tar files to start fresh (after warning).
