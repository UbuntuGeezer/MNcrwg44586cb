<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>The ArchivingBackups project is the central information point regarding
the file archiving and backup provisions. Currently there is no "make" 
file. The "Territories" portion of the project relates to backing up and
restoring the Territories subsystem.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Territories Subsystem.</h3>

<p>Territory management for the congregation is a complex system requiring
code and utilities that cross many boundaries. To bring the implementation
under one roof a complete Territories Subsystem has been developed. Currently
the subsystem is GNU/Linux based. However, it has been developed in such
a way as to faclitiate future porting to Windows based systems. The Territories
Subsystem consists of three major segments, code, data, and release.</p>

<p>The data segment is divided into two major sections. The residential section
is comprised of subdirectories RawData, TerrData and their
child directories. The business section is comprised of subdirectories
BRawData, BTerrData and their child directories. The download templates
and maps for both the residential and business sections are in subdirectory
Territory-PDFs.</p>

<p>The code segment spans multiple directories that also contain child
subdirectories. It contains all of the development source code, tools,
and development data for the Territory Subsystem. The principal subdirectories
are Basic, BRawData, BTerrData, Procs-Build, Procs-Dev, Projects-Geany,
Queries-SQL, RawData, ReleaseData, TerrData, UserInterface, and 'include'.</p>

<p>The release segment resides in the <em>ReleaseData</em> subdirectory and its child
subdirectories. It contains the release capsules that have been assembled
for distribution to those having territory oversight in the congregation.
Its child subdirectories are date-stamped folders named Release_mm-dd-yy
where 'mm', 'dd', and 'yy' are the release month, day and year.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Territories Code Segment.</h3>

<p>The primary backup and restore of the code segment is via <em>git</em> push/pull
operations to/from github.com.  Primary residence of the Territories git
project is on the Windows HDD in the GitHub subdirectory. A clone (devel)
for development purposes resides on the ~/Territories subdirectory.</p>

<p>When code changes are committed in the (devel) clone, they move its *master
branch ahead of the GitHub project. To ensure that changes would not be
lost in the event of a Windows HDD failure, two steps are necessary;
a "pull" operation from the GitHub git Territories project, followed by
a "push" operation from the GitHub git Territories repository upstream
to the github.com Territories repository.</p>

<p>A second method of backing up the Territories code segment is to use
PJDUMP to clone the GitHub Territories repository to a flash drive. With
either method of backup, it must be kept in mind that the data segment
of the Territories project is backed up separately.</p>

<p>The BU-Ignores shell copies to a flash drive using the -r and -u parameters
of the cp utility to process each entry in the .gitignore file for the
Territories repository. This way any files or file patterns ignored by
git maintaining the code segment will be backed up to the repository
residing on the flash drive.</p>

<p>See also: README, README-Projects, README-System.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 Territories Data Segment.</h3>

<p>The primary backup and restore of the data segment is via incremental
dumps of the data subdirectories using tar, or dumping to a flash drive
using the BU-Ignores shell. A secondary backup of the "released" data
is on the GoogleDrive for vnc.wmk3 in the CongInfoExhange/Territories folder.</p>

<p>tar backups of the data segment use the tar archiving utility to create
either full or incremental backups of RawData and TerrData. The incremental
dumps are stored on the Windows HDD until copied to a flash drive. The
advantage to this is that the incremental dumps are quite fast, and do not
require the data segment sudirectory structure. Incremental dumps are
most useful if a data file is corrupted by the development code and needs
to be quickly reloaded. The intent is that incremental dumps can be done
daily or more frequently, and used from the Windows HDD for quick file
recovery. If desired, then incrementals could be transfered to a flash
drive at the end of the week, or any time in the interim. These incremental
dumps are not fully compressed, so may not fit on flash drives with
limited capacity.</p>

<p>tar full dumps of the RawData and TerrData will typically be done to a
flash drive. These are the primary source of data recovery in the event
of a system or Windows HDD failure. Unlike the incremental dumps, the
full dumps will be in a compressed format to a file with the suffix
".tar.gz". At a minimum, full dumps should be performed weekly, and
whenever there has been a major download from SCPA or RefUSA. The shell
file RestartAllIncs.sh sets up for full dumps of all the data segment
files.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="5.0">5.0 Territories Release Segment.</h3>

<p>The <em>ReleaseData</em> folder for any given congregation's territory is a specialized
set of <em>tar</em> dumps grouping TerrData publisher-ready territories
for upload. The upload will typically be onto a system like GoogleDrive
or any "cloud" file system.</p>

<p>For development, the cloud system path is <em>GoogleDrive/CongInfoExchange/Territories</em>.
Separate folders named for each release date contain the territory
data. The naming convention for the release date folders is <em>Release_mm-dd-yy</em>
where  mm dd yy are the month, day, and year of the release.</p>

<p>Within each release date folder the congregation territories are grouped
into tarballs of manageable size. The tarballs have the filename extension
<em>.tar</em>, produced by the GNU <em>tar</em> utility. ("tar" is an acronym for "tape
archive"). These are compressed images of the files that <em>tar</em> has placed
into the tarball. (To facilitate extraction on various hosts, they are
not further compressed into ".gz" format). Most hosts (e.g. Windows, Unix,
Linux, GNU, etc.) have a utility that can extract files from <em>.tar</em> files.</p>

<p>Territories are grouped into tarballs of manageable size for uploading,
downloading, emailing, etc. To facilitate information sharing they are grouped
by territory number. (On the development system the groupings are Terrs 101-199,
Terrs 201-299, Terrs 301-399, and Terrs 600-699. The
specialized tar dumps are named Terr101-199.tar, Terr201-200.tar
Terr301-399.tar and Terr600-699.tar).</p>

<p>The tarballs save space on GoogleDrive, but still provide the data for multi-user
access. The rclone command line utility is used to copy the tarballs to the appropriate
GoogleDrive folders.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="6.1">6.1 Single Territory Archiving.</h3>
Because of resident hdd disk space limitations on the Chromebook provision has been
made to dump and load individual territories using their own .tar archive. The origin
system had enough resident hdd space to support all of the territories' data being
continually resident. The ArchivingBackups for the origin system are full backups
of each major Territories segment (i.e. FLSARA86777RawDataSC.n.tar is the set of
all RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads incremental dumps, FLSARA86777RawDataRU.n.tar is
the set of all RawData/RefuSA/RefuSA-Downloads incremental dumps; both including
all of the /Special/<special-db>.dbs)

Reloading the data for any individual territory from the full backups can be
accomplished, but is a bit rigorous. To provide for creating a "contained" backup
of an individual territory two new shells were added to ArchivingBackups.
<pre><code>    DumpTerr - dump all data for a single territory
    ReloadTerr - reload individual files or all data for a single territory
</code><pre>
These shells allow for dumping and loading of territory data on the Chromebook
system on an "as needed" basis. Single territories can then be managed and
generated without all of the territory data segment being resident on the
Chromebook hdd.<br>
Single territory archives are named CBTerrxxx.0.tar. The naming convention
mimics the naming convention for incrmental dumps using '0' as the dump-level
indicator since this is the full dump of the territory. The following folders 
are contained in any territory 'xxx' archive:<br>
<pre><code>    RawData/RefUSA/RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx
    RawData/RefUSA/RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx/Previous
    RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx
    RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx/Previous
    TerrData/Terrxxx
    TerrData/Terrxxx/Working-Files
</code><pre>
Territories that use /Special databases also need those databases loaded in order
to be managed and generated. Their single territory archive will also contain a
snapshot of the special territory db,s they are dependent upon. These will appear
in the territory archive as:<br>
<pre><code>    RawData/RefuSA/RefUSA-Downloads/Special/<special-db1>.db
    RawData/RefuSA/RefUSA-Downloads/Special/<special-db2>.db
    RawData/RefuSA/RefUSA-Downloads/Special/<special-db3>.db
    . . .
    RawData/RefuSA/RefUSA-Downloads/Special/<special-dbn>.db

    RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Special/<special-db1>.db
    RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Special/<special-db2>.db
    RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Special/<special-db3>.db
    . . .
    RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Special/<special-dbn>.db
</code></pre>

<p><strong>TerrIDData.db</strong>
The /DB-Dev/TerrIDData.db has been modified to support territories having
special databases. Since this database is ALWAYS resident on the Chromebok
system, it provides all of the information necessary for dumping and loading
of individual territory archives.<br>
The <em>Territory</em> table has been modified with two new fields added, "SpecialRU"
and "SpecialSC". These are both type INTEGER with a value of 0 indicating
no special db,s and 1 indicating has special db(s).<br>
Two new tables have also been added, <em>SpecialRU</em> and <em>SpecialSC</em>. Both these tables
have two fields "TID" and "SpecialDB". Any territory dependent upon 
RefUSA-Downloads/Special/&lt; special-dbs >.db will have a record in the <em>SpecialRU</em> 
table containing its territory ID and &lt; special-db > name for each &lt; special-db >.db
it is dependent upon. Likewise, any territory dependent upon SCPA-Downloads/Special/&lt; special-dbs >
will have a record in the <em>SpecialSC</em> table containing its territory ID and
&lt; special-db > name for each &lt; special-db >.db it is dependent upon.<br>
<strong>/Special Database Handling.</strong>
Within "DumpTerr" several ArchivingBackups files are used for handling special
databases:<pre><code>    GetTerrRUSpecList.psq - template for .sql query that extracts the SpecialRU
     database list from TerriDData.db
    GetTerrSCSpecList.psq - template for .sql query that extracts the SpecialSC
     database list from TerriDData.db
    MakeGenRUSpecList - makefile for creating GetTerrRUSpecList.sh
    MakeGenSCSpecList - makefile for creating GetTerrSCSpecList.sh
    GetTerrRUSpecList.sh - shell for generating SpecRUDumpList.txt
    GetTerrSCSpecList.sh - shell for generating SpecSCDumpList.txt
    SpecRUDumpList.txt - list of RefUSA/Special databases for territory
    SpecSCDumpList.txt - list of SCPA/Special databases for territory
 </code></pre>If the territory being archived has /Special &lt; special-db >.db dependencies
DumpTerr will have generated SpecRUDumpList.txt and/or SpecSCDumpList.txt as the
list of databases required to be archived with the territory. Any &lt; special-db >.db
files will be appended to the "regular" territory files in the dump.

<h3 id="9.0">9.0 External Archiving.</h3>
The *ArchivingBackups* project will archive the various *tar* compressed archive files
to an external USB flash drive. The utility *FlashBacks* will update the target flash
drive with the latest *tar* dumps.

All *tar* dumps are performed to the Territories system folder pointed to by the
*pathbase* environment var. This system folder will be resident on the computer-resident
HDD or SSD. To be prepared for a system HDD or SSD drive failure, the *tar* dumps should
also be preserved on a removable device (like a flash drive).

The *FlashBacks* shell will update the target flash drive with the latest *tar* dumps
from the data, code and release segments. To allow for multiple Territory systems being
resident on the same flash drive, FlashBacks will always dump files to the folder
<state><county><congno> on the root level of the flash drive (e.g. /FLSARA86777 would
be the dump folder containing all *tar* dumps for Florida, Sarasota, congregation 86777).

The *tar* dump files in the Territory system *tar* folder will have identical names
and dates of their counterparts on the HDD/SSD computer system drive. As a general rule
it is a good idea to execute FlashBacks at the end of any IncDumpxxx series of *tar*
dumps.

Usage.  ./FlashBacks <state> <county> <congno>

  <state> = 2-character state abbreviation
  <county> = 4-character county abbreviation
  <congno> = congregation number

Each *tar* dump folder on the target flash drive will have an associated subfolder
named *log*. This contains vital tracking information for the *tar dump files in
the parent folder.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a>
<h3 id="10.0">10 Supporting Code and Utilities.</h3>
The Territories portion is supported by several shell files that perform
backup and restore operations specific to Territories. The dump shells all
create .tar files in the ./Territories folder. The shell files
are as follows:

TARBALL - general purpose tar/create shell for specified subfolders of
  directory user currently in as ($)PWD; creates compressed tar.gz.

FlashBacks - backup .tar files from ./Territories folder to specified flash drive.

RestartdAllIncs - reset all incrmentental dump tracking so next incremental dump
starts at 0 (full dump).

IncDumpTerrData - incremental dump of TerrData directories which contain
  publisher-ready territory spreadsheets, PDFs, and associated work files.

IncDumpRawData - incremental dump of RawData directories which contain
  downloads from SCPA and RefUSA.

IncDumpTerrData - incrementeal dump of TerrData directories which contain working files and generated territories

IncDumpMainDBs - incremental dump of main (critical) databases like PolyTerri.db, MultiMail.db, AuxTerrData, TerrIDData, etc.

IncDumpGeany - incremental dump of Projects-Geany within Territories.

BU-Ignores - dump of data segement files ignored by GitHub from list in
  .gitignore; uncompressed to flash drive ./git-Projects/Territories.

TerrFullData - full tar compressed dump of data segment files from listed
  data segement subdirectories to flash; excludes SCPA full download files.

TerrGoogle101 - tar compressed dump of publisher territory files from
  TerrData folders Terr101 - Terr199.

TerrGoogle201 - tar compressed dump of publisher territory files from
  TerrData folders Terr201 - Terr299.

TerrGoogle301 - tar compressed dump of publisher territory files from
  TerrData folders Terr301 - Terr399.

UploadGoogleTerrs - upload the tar compressed publisher territory files
  from TerrData to the CongInfoExchange folders on GoogleDrive.

Detailed descriptions for these shells is contained in the following **bold** sections.

**TARBALL Shell [ShellFiles].**
The TARBALL shell is a bash proc file to simplify archiving of a Territories
subfolder set. It takes 2 command line parameters, the folder base for
gathering archive files, and the tar target file path. It should be run
from the folder base path to be archived. To simplify matters for tar,
the target file is best located not on the folder base (typically, one
could use ../<targetfileto place the tar file in the parent directory
of the area to be archived).


**IncDumpRawData Shell [ArchivingBackups].**
The IncDumpRawData shell performs incremental dumps of the
Territories/RawData folder set. This folder set contains the current
publisher territory spreadsheets and .pdf files and their associated
Working-Files used in the spreadsheet build process. There are no
command line parameters for the IncDumpRawData shell.

When the IncDumpRawData shell is invoked, it checks for the existence
of the ./log/TerrData.snar-0 file. If this file does not exist, a level-0
incremental tar is run which will dump the entire set of files and
folders included in ./RawData as a base for future incremental dumps.
The level-0 "listed-incremental" file is named RawData.snar-0.

When the ./log/TerrData.snar-0 file exists at IncDumpRawData starup, a level-1
incremental tar is run which will only dump the files [and new folders]
that have changed since the level-0 tar dump.

Each run of IncDumpRawData will produce a new .tar file in the parent
directory ../Territories, or on the root folder of a specified drive.
The level-0 .tar file is named RawData.0.tar.

    ./IncDumpRawData.sh [drive-spec e.g $U\_DISK/Lexar]

All subsequent level-1 .tar files are named RawData.1.tar, etc. Note
that none of these .tar files are compressed beyond the basic file 
compression that tar utilizes by default. Further compression would
prevent incremental dumping.

Eventually this shell may be supported in the ~/sysprocs folder for use
as a daily timed event to perform daily incremental backups to a removable
media, such as a flash drive.


**IncDumpTerrData Shell. [ArchivingBackups]**
The IncDumpTerrData shell performs incremental dumps of the
Territories/TerrData folder set. This folder set contains the current
publisher territory spreadsheets and .pdf files and their associated
Working-Files used in the spreadsheet build process. There are no
command line parameters for the IncDumpTerrData shell.

When the IncDumpTerrData shell is invoked, it checks for the existence
of the ./log/TerrData.snar-0 file. If this file does not exist, a level-0
incremental tar is run which will dump the entire set of files and
folders included in ./TerrData as a base for future incremental dumps.
The level-0 "listed-incremental" file is named TerrData.snar-0.

When the ./log/TerrData.snar-0 exists at IncDumpTerrData starup, a level-1
incremental tar is run which will only dump the files [and new folders]
that have changed since the level-0 tar dump.

Each run of IncDumpTerrData will produce a new .tar file in the parent
directory ../Territories. The level-0 .tar file is named TerrData.0.tar.
All subsequent level-1 .tar files are named TerrData.1.tar, etc. Note
that none of these .tar files are compressed beyond the basic file 
compression that tar utilizes by default. Further compression would
prevent incremental dumping.

Eventually this shell may be supported in the ~/sysprocs folder for use
as a daily timed event to perform daily incremental backups to a removable
media, such as a flash drive.


**BU-Ignores.** [Territories]
BU-Ignores dumps all files and file patterns present in .gitignore for
the Territories project. The target for the dump is a flash drive with
the folder git-Projects/Territories. The subdirectory structures are
retained from the Territories project. The dump is performed so that it
mimics an "incremental" dump using the -r and -u parameters of the cp
utility to only copy "updated" files.

**TerrGoogle101.** [ArchivingBackups]
TerrGoogle101 generates a tar compressed dump of publisher territory
files from TerrData folders Terr101 - Terr199. These territories are
regular house-to-house territories for which all addresses have been
downloaded from SCPA and RefUSA data. They will eventually be uploaded
to GoogleDrive folder CongInfoExchange/Territories/'Terrs 101 - 199'.

**TerrGoogle201.** [ArchivingBackups]
TerrGoogle201 generates a tar compressed dump of publisher territory
files from TerrData folders Terr201 - Terr299. These territories are
regular house-to-house territories for which all addresses have been
downloaded from SCPA and RefUSA data. They will eventually be uploaded
to GoogleDrive folder CongInfoExchange/Territories/'Terrs 201 - 299'.

**TerrGoogle301.** [ArchivingBackups]
TerrGoogle301 generates a tar compressed dump of publisher territory
files from TerrData folders Terr301 - Terr399. These territories are
regular house-to-house territories for which all addresses have been
downloaded from SCPA and RefUSA data. They will eventually be uploaded
to GoogleDrive folder CongInfoExchange/Territories/'Terrs 301 - 399'.

**TerrGoogle4xx.** [ArchivingBackups]
TerrGoogle4xx generates a tar compressed dump of publisher territory
files from TerrData folders Terr4xx - Terr9xx. These territories are
regular house-to-house territories for which all addresses have been
downloaded from SCPA and RefUSA data. They will eventually be uploaded
to GoogleDrive folder CongInfoExchange/Territories/'Terrs 4xx - 9xx'.

**UploadGoogleTerrs.** [ArchivingBackups]
UploadGoogeTerrs uploads the tar compressed publisher territory files
from TerrData to the CongInfoExchange folders on GoogleDrive. The files
uploaded are GTerr101-199.tar.gz, GTerr201-299.tar.ga, GTerr301-399.tar.gz,
and GTerr4xx-5xx.tar.gz. Each file will be uploaded to its respective
folder under CongInfoExchange/Territories. Publisher territories may
then be extracted from this repository as needed.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a>

Following are the full paths to the archiving and backups currently
tracked by this documentation. Note that any .tar or .tar.gz files that
reside in the paths RawData or TerrData will be ignored by git when
tracking projects. If .tar or .tar.gz files are placed on any paths
upstream or parallel to these paths, they may have to be explicitly
listed in the .gitignore file for Territories to avoid the overhead of
tracking by git.
