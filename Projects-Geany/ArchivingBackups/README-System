Project Description.
--------------------
The ArchivingBackups project is a central information point regarding
the file archiving and backup provisions. Currently there is no "make" 
file. The "System" portion of the project relates to backing up and
restoring the ubuntu-live-user (transient ubuntu) system. Currently the
transient ubuntu system is extremely depenedent on the Windows HDD file
system. In the event of a Windows HDD failure
or accessibility issues (e.g. read-only file system), the backup and
restore procedures here are essential.

Supporting Code and Utilities.
------------------------------
The System portion is supported by several shell files that perform
backup and restore operations specific to the ubuntu-live-user system.
The shell files for the system backup and restore reside in the
GitHub/ShellFiles folder and are:

PJDUMP - dump files from any GitHub project to flash drive using git
  clone operation.

ReloadSSH - reload the .ssh system files for facilitating SSH protocol
  transfers to/from GitHub.

Reload-rclone - reload the rclone configuration files that facilitate
  rclone transfers to/from GoogleDrive gcloud: (vnc.wmk3@gmail).

SETBACK - set ($)BACKUP_PATH env var to mounted flash drive to use for
  backups or restores.
