Project Description.
--------------------
The ArchivingBackups project is a central information point regarding
the file archiving and backup provisions. Currently there is no "make" 
file. The "Projects" portion of the ArchivingBackups relates to backing
up and restoring git projects from the Windows HDD to flash drives.
Currently the git projects are extremely depenedent on the Windows HDD
file system, residing on Windows/Users/Bill/Documents/GitHub. In the
event of a Windows HDD failure or accessibility issues (e.g. read-only
file system), the backup and restore procedures here are essential.

Many of the GitHub projects are maintained on github.com by doing
push/pull git operations, with the github.com repositories set up
as "remote" repositories for the projects. For these projects, github.com
will be considered the primary backup source.

Special Note. The GitHub projects Territories and ShellFiles currently 
use the github.com repositories as their primary backup source. The
flash drive backups of these projects are out-of-date. The data portion
of the Territories git project, namely RawData and TerrData and their
subdirectories, are backed up and restored apart from the github.com
Territories repository. See README-Territories for further information.

Supporting Code and Utilities.
------------------------------
The Projects portion is supported by several shell files that perform
backup and restore operations specific to the GitHub projects.
The shell files for the system backup and restore reside in the
GitHub/ShellFiles folder and are:

PJDUMP - dump files from any GitHub project to flash drive using git
  clone operation.
