Project Description.
-------------------
The SCNewLetter project creates a database that emulates the database
created by the SCNewTerritory_db.db within Terryyy SCPA-Download folder.
It takes a .csv file of letter writing addresses and converts them into
a Terryyy_SCPoly table that looks exactly like a Terryyy_SCPoly table
created from a Mapyyy_RU.csv download.

It then creates a Terryyy_SCBridge table that is exactly like the SCBridge
table created by SCNewTerritory project. This essentially spoofs the system
into handling a letter writing territory as though it were created from
an SC download. Once the Terryyy_SC.db is created, it is handled exactly
the same as any SC territory download.

This project should be run before the RUNewLetter project build.


Dependencies.
-------------

NewLetter.sql - SQL to create new Terryyy_SC.db and populate from Letteryyy_TS.csv

Lettyyy_TS.csv - .csv created by using Calc, cutting/pasting Lett632_TS.pdf
	lines into cells, then exporting to a .csv file. By using <space> as the
	field separator, the .pdf lines are parsed into fields that closely resemble
	a Mapyyy_SCPoly record.

Terryyy_SC.db - empty new database with same structure as any Terryyy_SC.db

TIDList.txt - optional list of territory IDs to process for MvDwnPDF.sh

Method.
-------
To create a new letter-writing territory peform the following steps:

The first step is to obtain the letter writing territory TS definition
by downloading Letter_xxx.pdf from territory servant. This file will be
located in the Territory-PDFs folder.

/Procs-Dev folder:
	run ./MvDwnPDF.sh xxx to move the download PDF into the 
	 SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder

SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder:
	open the .pdf in Adobe Reader
	
	open a new spreadsheet in Calc
	
	copy and paste all lines 1st 2 fields from the .pdf into the new Calc
	 spreadsheet starting at row 2
	
	Add the column headings:
	 AreaName, HouseNumber, Street1, Street2, Street3, Unit, City, empty,
	  State, Zip

	combine any columns A and B that have a split area name into column A
	 (e.g. 'Bridle' 'Oaks' becomes 'Bridle Oaks' in column A
	 move columns at right left 1 column so that house number is in column B
	align remaining column data under appropriate headings; watch out for Units
	 
	Save the spreadsheet as Lettxxx_TS.ods

	From new spreadsheet AreaName column, make a list of the different
	 area names
	 
	Save the spreadsheet as Lettxxx_TS.csv
	
	
/DB-Dev folder:
	open database TerrIDData.db
	
	create a new record in table "Territory" with the relevant information
	 obtained from the Letter_xxx.TS.ods to define the territory
	 
/Procs-Dev folder:
	run GenTerrHdr.sh <terrid> to generate the territory header .csv
	
	run Calc to process the TerrxxxHdr.csv and save as TerxxxHdr.ods

Enter the SCNewLetter project:

	in the Build commands, set "sed" parameter to territory ID
	run "sed" from the Buid menu to set up MakeSCNewLetter makefile
	 and edit the territory ID into NewLetter.sql

	run Make from the Build menu to execute the SQL from NewLetter.sql
	 creating Terrxxx_SC.db from the Lettxxx_TS.csv data
	 MakeSCNewLetter will also create an empty Mapxxx_RU.csv file and
	  generate an empty Terrxxx_RU.db in the RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx
	  folder

Terminal: Projects-Geany/SCNewLetter project folder:

	run InitLetter.sh to copy the files:
	 LETTER, ~/Territory-PDFs/Letter_yyy.pdf, AddZips.sql, MakeAddZips
	 to ~SCPA-Downloads/Terr<terrid>

Back in the SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder:

	Use sqlite brower to review Terrxxx_SC.db, checking record data for
	 missing fields like OwningParcel, etc.
	
	If there are any missing, or incorrect fields (like Units) or 
	 street names needing correction (e.g. Crossing > Xing):
	---- 
	 Code the fixes for Terrxxx into FixyyySC.sql SQL source. This code
	  will use the information from VeniceNTerritory.NVenAll to set the
	  basic information in each record.
	
	 Terminal: move to the FixAnySC project folder (cdj FixAnySC)
	 execute the ClearTargets.sh shell with the territory ID

	 move back to the SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder
	 rm the Terrxxx_SC.db database to clear the way for rebuilding with
	  UpdateRUDwnld project
	
Enter the FixAnySC project:

		set the territory ID into the "sed" Build menu item
		run "sed" from the Build menu
		run Make from the Build menu to create the FixyyySC.sh shell
		that will be invoked by then UpdateSCBridge project

re-enter the SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder
	run ./FixxxxSC.sh to perform an initial fix on the records needing
	 to be corrected
	----
	
	edit AddZips.sql to ensure proper SQL for adding zip codes this territory
	[run make -f MakeAddZips --dry-run to test the AddZips makefile]
	run make -f MakeAddZips to make the AddZips.sh shell
	run the ./AddZips.sh shell to add the zip codes into the UnitAddresses
	
/TerrData/Terrxxx folder: [Note: if you omit here, BridgesToTerr will remind you]
	run Calc to open TerrxxxHdr.csv
	save as TerrxxxHDR.ods
	
[Note: this step has been incorporated into the MakeSCNewLetter makefile.]
Enter the RUNewTerritory project:

	set the territory ID into the "sed" Build menu item
	run "sed" from the Build menu
	
	run Make from the Build menu to create the Terrxxx_RU.db anew
	 with no records, to placate territory generation

The letter writing territory will use one or more RefUSA-Downloads/Special
dbs to extract its own records from the RefUSA databases for the
RefUSA records to be included in the generated territory. But in order for
this to work, the SCBridge table in Terrxxx_SC.db must be completed.

The letter writing territory is now set to work just like any other
territory. Special processing should be added to include the RU data
addresses. The RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx/MakeSpecials makefile will 
run several shells to make the Specxxx_RU.db, then populate the Terrxxx_RU.db
by merging in the Specxxx_RU.db.Specxxx_RUBridge entries.
