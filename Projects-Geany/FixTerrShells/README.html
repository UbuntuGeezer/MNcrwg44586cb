<h2>Project Description.</h2>

<p>FixTerrMakes is a "reliability" project that goes through a list of territories
then processes each territory's folder <em>make</em> files
and batch edits them to be consistent with all "makes" for a given
Territory system. The most obvious is to ensure the makefile is using the
environment variable <em>pathbase</em> in all file referencing operations that
are in recipes and variable assignments. The single build uses <em>sed</em>, <em>awk</em> and
<em>cat</em> to modify the <em>make</em> files in a specific folder (typically a territory
download or Geany project folder.</p>

<p>The project will also be used when creating new congregation Territory
systems. There are hundreds <em>make</em> files within a Territory system, many
of which have path dependencies on the <em>folderbase</em>, <em>basepath</em> and
<em>congterr</em> environment variables. Whenever these system-wide environment
variables are changed, the downstream <em>make</em> files will be
affected. FixTerrMakes, especially the FixAllTerrMakes shell, facilitates rapidly
editing all affected <em>make</em> files..</p>

<h2>Setup.</h2>

<p>FixTerrMakes has  "stand-alone" shells that fix <em>make</em> files.</p>

<p>FixTerrMake.sh fixes a single territory's makefiles. FixAllTerrMakes.sh fixes all
makefiles for territories in the TIDList.txt file. The TIDList.txt file resides
on the <em>SpecialRUDB</em> project path. The most common makefile needing modification
across territories is <em>MakeSpecials</em>. Each territory that uses special databases
from the RefUSA-Downloads/Special folder has its own <em>MakeSpecials</em> makefile. Within
that makefile is a territory-specific list of /Special databases that are linked
to the territory.</p>

<p>FixTerrMake shell has 2 parameters &lt; path > &lt; file >. &lt; path > is the
full path to the file; &lt; file > is the base filename (e.g. MakeSpecials).</p>
