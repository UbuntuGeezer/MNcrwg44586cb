##Project Description.
The *Documentation* project contains the documentation for the *Territory*
system. (couldn't resist on commenting about the redundancy in the first
sentence.. a harbinger of what's to come in the remaining documentation!)

##Document Links.
The links to the Territory system documents are grouped by area of interest.
The groups are:
<pre><code>System Requirements - documents pertaining to hardware, operating
 system, and installed application requirements for the Territory system.
 
User Documents - documents pertaining to users of the Territory system,
 primarily for publishers using territories distributed from the system and
 those using the Territory system for tracking and distributing territories.

Territory Data - documents pertaining to the general organization of the data
 segment, setting up territories within the Territory system, populating and
 updating territory data, and technical documentation on data structures.
