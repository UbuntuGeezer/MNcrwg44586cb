<h2>Project Description.</h2>

<p>The <em>Documentation</em> project contains the documentation for the <em>Territory</em>
system. (couldn't resist on commenting about the redundancy in the first
sentence.. a harbinger of what's to come in the remaining documentation!)</p>

<h2>Document Links.</h2>

The groups are:</p>

<pre><code>System Requirements - documents pertaining to hardware, operating

 primarily for publishers using territories distributed from the system and
 those using the Territory system for tracking and distributing territories.
