Project Description.
--------------------
extracts territory IDs and DNC counts from TerrIDData.DoNotCalls
and writes to DNCSummary.csv
DNCSummary.csv may then be used to update the DNC counts in 
the SystemTracker.ods.

Results.
--------
DNCReport produces a DoNotCall summary in the {DoTerrsWithCalc}/Tracking folder.
File DNCSummary.csv contains a .csv that can be imported into Calc, then
used to update all the DNC counts in the RefUSA-Downloads sheet. (All of
the RefUSA-Downloads DNC count fields are linked to the SCPA-Downloads
sheet so they stay in sync.

Once the user copies and pastes the DNCSummary counts into the RefUSA-Downloads
sheet, all of the date fields for the DNC Update column should be set to
the date of the update.

Setup.
------
Build menu:
	run 'Execute' from Build menu

OR

Terminal: /Geany-Projects/DNCReport
	run ./DNCReport.sh

/Tracking/DNCSummary.csv is ready to import into the SystemTracking workbook.
