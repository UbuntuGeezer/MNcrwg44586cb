Raw Data Structure - data structure of SC territory database.


Project Description.
--------------------
SCNewTerritory takes download data from the SCPA records and creates a
database with the download records and Bridge table for territory generation.
The download records are assumed to be "map" download records from the
SCPA master online database in polygon record format, as opposed to full
records taken directly from the SCPA full download data.

Setup.
------
Perform the following steps when building a new SC territory:

	edit "sed" item in the Buid menu with the territory ID
	run "sed" from the Build menu
	
	run "Make Dry Run from the Build menu to check the new territory
	projected execution
	
	run "Make" from the Build menu to generate the SC territory database.
	

Raw Data Structure.
-------------------
Following is the table structure of the map polygon data. In the first
pass at generating territories, the "by shape" feature was used to draw
polygons on the SC aerial map to obtain the addresses. The resulting
.csv download records all have the following SQL fields present:

CREATE TABLE Terrxxx_SCPoly
( Account TEXT, Name TEXT, Name2 TEXT, ADDRESS TEXT, CITY TEXT,
 STATE TEXT, ZIP TEXT, COUNTRY TEXT, LOCATIONNAME TEXT,
 LOCATIONSTREET TEXT, LOCATIONDIRECTION TEXT, UNIT TEXT,
 LOCATIONCITY TEXT, LOCATIONZIP TEXT)

As can be seen from the table definition, the .csv fields are imported
directly into table Terrxxx_SCPoly where xxx is the territory ID.

A provision has been made to take download data from the SCPA full download
database. This provision covers cases where entire streets are necessary
to have in a database, where the street spans two or more territories.
The SpecialSCdb project handles these databases. Where a territory makes
use of this provision, its raw data will contain documentation in
file SPECIAL, and a secondary database Specxxx_SC.db of special records
that in Bridge format for inclusion in the generated territory.
(See the SpecialSCdb project documentation README for further information.)


Significant Notes.
------------------
SCNewTerritory should be run to build the SC territory prior to building
the RUNewTerritory. RUNewTerritory depends upon the Terrxxx_SC.db, even
if there are no records (e.g. mobile home park). An empty Terrxxx_SCBridge
table is built.
