<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>FlagRUUpdates is a project to be "built" when
managing RefUSA territory updates. For an overview of the process of updating a
territory see the section <a href="#3.0">Updating a Territory</a>. FlagRUUpdtates
will search the RefUSA-Downloads/Terxxx folders for cases where the file
Terrxxx_RU.db is older than Mapxxx_RU.csv. If the file "SPECIAL" is present in the
/Terrxxx folder, the /Special/Make.&lt; spec-db >.Terr files will be searched for
references to the Terrxxx folder. For any &lt; spec-db >.Terr files where the
territory is found in the $(MAKE) directives the dates on those &lt; spec-db >.db
files will be compared with the date on Terrxxx_RU.db. If the Terrxxx_RU.db file
is older than the /Special/&lt; spec-db >.db, it is considered out-of-date.</p>

<p>If just one of the /Special/&lt; spec-db >.db,s used by a territory is newer than
the Terrxxx_RU.db, the territory is considered out-of-date. The *MakeSpecials*
makefile should be processed by *make* to bring the RefUSA data for the
territory up-to-date. </p>

<p>FlagRUUpdates is a support project for the SyncAllData project. For a
comprehensive explanation of synchronizing all of the data segment elements
see the
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/SyncAllData/README.html">SyncAllData</a>
project documentation.

<h3 id="2.0">2/0 Setup.</h3>

<p>The target produced by FlagRUPdates is the file RUtidList.txt within the
project. This is the list of territories that were found to be out-of-date
within the RefUSA portion of the data segment.</p>

<p>FlagRUUpdates Project:</p>

<pre><code>
        edit the \*sed command in the build menu with start/end territory ids
        run \*sed from the build menu
        run \*Make from the build menu
</code></pre>

<p>When the *make* completes, RUtidList.txt contains a list of all the RefUSA
territories that are out-of-date. In order to bring these territories
up-to-date the RefUSA data for each territory should be downloaded to get
the latest information. RUtidList.txt contains the list of territories
which can be supplied to the <em>UpdateRUDwnld</em> project once the data has
been freshly downloaded. For further details see the
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/UpdateRUDwnld/README.html">UpdateRUDwnld</a>

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Updating a Territory.</h3>

<p><strong>Overall Sequence.</strong><br>
When updating a territory with new download data, perform the following sequence:</p>

<pre><code>
    Download the latest SC data to /SCPA-Downloads/SCPA\_mm-dd.db
     (e.g. SCPA\_02-27.db is the download from 2/27/21.)

    Build FlagRUUpdates (this build) for territory yyy

    Build UpdateSCBridge for territory yyy

    [ Terryyy\_SC.db/Terryyy\_SCBridge is now up-to-date ]

    Download the latest RU data for territory yyy to /RefUSA-Downloads/Terryyy

    Build UpdateRUDwnld for territory yyy

    [ Terryyy\_RU.db/Terryyy\_RUBridge is now up-to-date ]

    Build BridgesToTerr for territory yyy

    [ PolyTerri/MultiMail.dbs now up-to-date for territory yyy ]

    [ TerrData/Terryyy/Working-Files now has QTerryyy.csv base ]
</code></pre>

<p>To generate the updated PubTerr there is a project just for territory building.
The project name is <em>DoTerrsWithCalc</em>. This project has a LibreOfficeCalc
spreadsheet "ProcessQTerrs12.ods" that integrages the entire process of creating
a publisher-ready territory from the file in the TerrData/Working-Files folder
for the territory. It has an entire Calc library of support macros, <em>Territories</em>,
along with internally defined macros that accomplish the publisher territory build.
See the <em>DoTerrsWithCalc</em> project 
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/DoTerrsWithCalc/README.html">README</a>
 file for more documentation.</p>

<p>Following is a crude, and somewhat outdated, summary of what running the <em>Main</em> macro from ProcessQTerrs12.ods accomplishes:<br>
    Run Calc and open QTerryyy.csv<br>
     save as workbook QTerryyy.ods<br>
     open the TerryyyHdr.csv or .ods for the header<br>
     [save TerryyyHdr.csv as .ods for future use]<br>
     use alt-e to export the header to the QTerryyy.ods<br>
     use ctrl-w to close the header sheet<br>
     use ctrl-s to save the two-sheet QTerryyy.ods<br>
     change the tab color on QTerrxxx to dk-lime and protect<br>
     change the tab color on TerrxxHdr to dk-lime and protect<br>
     use ctrl-s to save the workbook<br>
     from the QTerrxxx sheet use ctrl-4 to generate the PubTerr<br>
     use ctrl-s in the new "untitled" sheet to save as Terrxxx_PubTerr.ods in the /TerrData/Terryyy folder
     Unprotect the Terrxxx_PubTerr sheet<br>
     Change the View to freeze rows and columns at 6A<br>
     Highlight all the data cells and use ctrl-F10 to align top and wrap text<br>
     Use ctrl-h to highlight the all the address groupings<br>
     Use ctrl-6 to set Landscape format and turn on grid lines<br>
     use ctrl-s to ensure the whole mess is saved<br>
     use ctrl-7 to save an .xlsx copy<br>
     use ctrl-8 to save a .pdf copy<br>
     use ctrl-w to close the PubTerr workbook<br>
     use ctrl-s and ctrl-w to close the QTerryyy.ods workbook<br></p>

<p>The SystemTracker.ods in the RawData/Tracking folder is used to track all changes. At each stage of the above process, the SystemTracker should be updated. (That is a whole separate topic...).<br>

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 Batch Runs of FlagRUUpdates.</h3>

<p>FlagRUUpdates can be run on multiple territories when updating after a
new SCPA download. The shell <em>FlagAllSCUpdates.sh</em> will read a list of
territory IDs to process from the <em>UpdateSCBridge</em> project and process
all listed territories. To set up this territory ID list see the
<a href="">UpdateSCBridge Documentation</a></p>

<p>After the TIDList.txt file has been set up in the <em>UpdateSCBridge</em> project
do the following to perform the batch run:</p>

<pre><code>
Terminal Session:
    cdj FlagRUUpdates to change to the project folder

    run the FlagAllSCUpdates shell with the following command:
     ./FlagAllSCUpdates.sh mm dd
     where mm dd is the month and day of the SCPA download (SCPADiff_mm-dd.db)
</code></pre>

<p>If any errors occur during the batch run they will be recorded on the
<em>TEMP_PATH</em>/MakeErrors.txt file.</p>
