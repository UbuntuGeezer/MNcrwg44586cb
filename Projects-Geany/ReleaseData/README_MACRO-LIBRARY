Description.
------------
The "Release" macro library has been created for spreadsheet power-users
that will be tasked with taking the Release territories and massaging them
into finalized publisher territories. The library name is "Release" and is
an Apache OpenOffice Calc library that can be imported into the installed
Calc on any system. At this time, there is no macro library for Windows
Excel.

The macro library is system-independent. It will run on either a Windows
or GNU/Linux system that has Apache Open Office (or Libre Office) and Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. Along with the macro library is a custom
keyboard configuration file that maps the user keyboard to the Release macro
library. This provides power-users with shortcut keys to manage the territory
spreadsheets.

When included in a release, the macro library is contained in its own
tarball. This requires separate extraction on the target system, followed
by integration into the installed version of Calc. This process is described
in the "Installation" section that follows.


Installation Files.
-------------------
Four files comprise the Release macro installation; Module1.xba, script.xlb,
dialog.xlb and ReleaseTerr.cfg.

Module1.xba - Basic source code (.xba file format) that will be imported into
 the Release macro library in Calc

script.xlb - Calc directives for attaching to the Basic source code and any
 dialog code

dialog.xlb - JRE frameworks code for any dialog frames (windows) used by
 the Basic code

ReleaseTerr.cfg - keyboard configuration file for territory management 
 power-users
 

Installation.
-------------
This section documents installing the Release macro library and its custom
keyboard for Apache OpenOffice Calc (or LibreOffice Calc). The macro library
is the code for supporting the custom keyboard named 'ReleaseTerr.cfg'. The
custom keyboard provides shortcut keys for massaging territory spreadsheets.

The name of the territories release macro library is TerrRelease. The entire
library is released in its own tarball TerrRelease.tar within the dated
Release_mm-dd-yy folder.

The files included in the TerrRelease folder that the tarball will expand
into are:

	Module1.xba
	dialog.xlb
	script.xlb

These files are read-only to prevent inadvertant modification on the target
system in which they are installed.

To install the TerrRelease macro library into OpenOffice/Calc perform the
following steps:

	Extract the files into a /TerrRelease folder on your system. (For 
	 recommendations on where to put the files, see the Release_10-28-0-21
	 RELEASE_NOTES instructions.) You will be targeting a path like
	 Territories/TerrRelease.
	
	Start an OpenOffice/Calc session
	
	From the main menu tabs select
		Tools>Macros>OrganizeMacros>Basic
	
	Within the "Basic Macros" window:
		Click the [Organizer..] button
		
	Within the "Basic Macros Organizer" window:
		Click the {Libraries} tab
		Click the [Import] button
	
	In the "Import Libraries" window:
		navigate to the Territories/TerrRelease folder
		highlight the file 'script.xlb'
		double-click on the filename or click on [Open] button
	
	In the "Import Libraries" (small window):
		Click the [OK] button
	
	In the "Basic Macros Organizer" window:
		'Release' should now be in your list of libaries
		Click the [Close] button
	
	In the "Basic Macros" window:
		Click the [Close] button
		
This will place you back into the "Untitled" spreadsheet.


The Release macro library is hooked to the ReleaseTerr.cfg keyboard file.
