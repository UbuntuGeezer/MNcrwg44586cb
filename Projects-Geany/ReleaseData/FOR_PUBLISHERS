Publisher territory files .xslx and.pdf Contents
	11/3/21.	wmk.

Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx and Terrxxx_PubTerr.pdf contain the following information:

	Both files contain all the addresses, names, and phone numbers from 2 sources,
	Sarasota County Property Search, and RefUSA address search.
	The file with the .xlsx name extension is a spreadsheet (Excel).
	The file with the .pdf name extension is an Adobe/Acrobat PDF.
	
	The information is formatted as follows:
	
	5 lines of header information with basic information about the territory,
	 and the date the publisher territory was generated. Included in this
	 infomation is the city and zip code of the addresses. (See Letter-writing
	 Territories below for exceptions).
	
	line 6 through whatever contain the territory addresses and names with
	the following column headings:
	UnitAddress, Unit, H, Name(s), Phone1, RefUSA, DNC, FL, Personal Notes
	
	The files are tagged as "landscape format" with "grid", so if printed
	 as much information as possible will fit on the page. On most systems
	 the "Personal Notes" column ends up on its own page.
	
Here is what is in each of the columns:
	 
	UnitAddress - the street address
	
	Unit - for multiple-dwelling buildings, or apartments, the unit #
	
	H - a '*' in this column indicates "homestead"; that is, the owner
	 is claiming homestead exemption with the county, so considers this
	 their permanent address
	
	Name(s) - name or names of residents; only county records will have
	 multiple names in one record (see "Name Grouping" below)
	 if this is a DoNotCall 'DO NOT CALL' will appear in the Name(s) column
	
	Phone1 - left empty if the publisher wishes to add a phone # found
	 via one of the people search engines

	RefUSA - the phone number listed with RefUSA for this address; if there
	 is no phone number in RefUSA it will read "Not Available"

	DNC - if set to '1' this is a DoNotCall

	FL - if set to '1' this is a Foreign-Language DoNotCall

	If the record information came from the Sarasota County Property search,
	the record text will be in all uppercase (e.g. 800 THE ESPLANADE N).
	If the record information came from the RefUSA search, the record text 
	will be in mixed case (e.g. 800 The Esplanade N).

Name Grouping.

Resident names are grouped in two ways. If the county data lists multiple
owners, all of the owner names appear in one cell, in uppercase, and separated
with commas (e.g. SMITH JOSEPH, SMITH MARY). If the property is owned by
a trust, often the secondary name(s) will be trustees. If the property is
H='*' homestead, likely one or more RefUSA names will match the trustees.

For RefUSA records, the names are one per record. If multiple residents
are in the RefUSA data for the same address, each resident will have their
own line of data.

If a given address has territory records on more than one line, the first
line of information is the first one encountered for the address. That line
will be highlighted in green. Subsequent lines that belong with the same
address will have the Unit column highlighted in blue. This makes it much
easier to see all the residents for one address. If there is county data
for the address likely (but not always) it will be the first line for the
address, will have data in all uppercase, and highlighted green.

Super Territories.
------------------

Super Territories are included with every regular and letter writing
territory. They are always in spreadsheet (Excel) files, and are best
used from a laptop, notebook, or desktop computer since most mobile
devices that can use spreadsheets do not have the full spreadsheet
functionality of following hyperlinks.

All Super Territories have the filename Terrxxx_SuperTerr.xlsx, where
'xxx' is the territory number. The spreadsheet file has two tabs, 
Terrxxx_PubTerr and Terrxxx_Search. The first tab, Terrxxx_PubTerr,
contains identical information to that in the Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx
spreadsheet. It is the "standard" publisher territory information.

The second tab, Terrxxx_Search, has the column headers rearranged along
with some additional columns. The columns in this sheet are:
H, Address, Unit, Name, Phone1, RefUSA, fastpeople, truepeople, 411, DNC, FL
The fastpeople, truepeople and 411 columns contain hyperlinks to enable
quick lookup for each address. (See the Hyperlinks segment below).

The following are the individual column descriptions/explanations:

H - "homestead"; if a '*' is present, this address and the associated Name(s)
	are listed as homestead in the Sarasota County Property records. This 
	implies that this address is the permanent address of the Name(s), so
	the named person(s) should receive mail at that address year-round.

Address - the street address of the location.

Unit - for addresses with units (condos, apartments, duplexes, etc) this
	is the unit #

Name - the name(s) of the residents; if uppercase (e.g. DOE JOHN) it is
	the name(s) from the SCPA county data; if mixed case (e.g. John Doe)
	it is the name from the RefUSA data. Note that names in the county
	are usually lastname first, from RefUSA are firstname first.

Phone1 - left blank; may be filled in by using hyperlink data. (See the 
	Hyperlinks segment below).
	
RefUSA - contains either the RefUSA listed phone number or "Not Available"

fastpeople - contains a hyperlink for searching www.fastpeoplesearch.com
	for this address; If you are using Excel, clicking on this cell will
	transfer you into your web browser to the 411.com website, with the
	address pre-loaded for you. (Some other spreadsheet packages like
	OpenOffice/Calc may require you to shift-click on the cell).
	
truepeople - contains a hyperlink for searching www.truepeoplesearch.com
	for this address; If you are using Excel, clicking on this cell will
	transfer you into your web browser to the 411.com website, with the
	address pre-loaded for you. (Some other spreadsheet packages like
	OpenOffice/Calc may require you to shift-click on the cell).
	
411 - contains a hyperlink for searching www.411.com for this address; If
	you are using Excel, clicking on this cell will transfer you into your
	web browser to the 411.com website, with the address pre-loaded for
	you. (Some other spreadsheet packages like OpenOffice/Calc may require
	you to shift-click on the cell).
	
DNC - if '1' this address/unit is in our Do Not Call list; As an added
	protection, the system places "DO NOT CALL" in the Name column.

FL - if '1', this is a foreign-language do-not-call


Hyperlinks.

In general a hyperlink is a special-case text that is a link to an external
source of information. Probably most are familiar with them in the JW
publications as blue-highlighted fields that may contain Bible verse links
or publication links (e.g. Is 55:8, w 02 23-24.). In the super territories
they are links that your browser can follow directly to web site information.

Hyperlinks to the 3 search engines, fastpeoplesearch, truepeoplesearch,
and 411 allow the user to jump directly into the desired search engine
without the tedium of typing in the address in the search engine search
dialog box. One "click" gets you directly there.

Most spreadsheet applications like Excel follow the convention of showing
hyperlinks as highlighted blue. In the Terrxxx_Search sheets the hyperlinks
are not highlighted, since they are "layered" under the text "Click here to
search".

Whatever column the "Click here to search" appears in, the hyperlink will
link out to your browser for the search engine listed in the column header
(e.g. fastpeople will link to fastpeoplesearch.com). The underlying
hyperlink supplies the search engine with a preloaded address field that
will send it directly to that information.

Many search engines are now protected with a layer of security that
precludes "robot" software from overloading the search engine. The first
time you visit one of these sites in your browser session, you may be required
to go through a verification to prove to the site that you are "human".
This usually involves checking a checkbox "I am human" and/or identifying
a series of pictures that follow a certain pattern (e.g. boats). Once you
have "passed", as long as your browser session remains active, you will
not have to repeat the "not-a-robot" verification for a given search engine.

Once through the "not-a-robot" verification you will be connected directly
to the address information for the site. By switching back and forth
between your browser window and your spreadsheet window, you can easily
compare information. The browser tab for the search engine/address will
remain active until you close it. Keep in mind that if you continue
clicking hyperlinks in the Super Territory, a new browser tab will be
opened every time you click a link. You may wish to do some periodic
"housekeeping" by closing browser tabs you are finished with.

THIS IS THE COOL STUFF: With a browser tab that is the web page for the
search information for a given address, all Windows operations may be
performed on the fields in the browser web page. This means that you
can "copy" and "paste" information from the web page back into your
Terrxxx_Search sheet. You can cut and paste additional phone numbers,
names, or any other information into your sheet for future reference.
By saving the Terrxxx_SuperTerr.xlsx file, your additions will be there
whenever you wish to use them in the future.
