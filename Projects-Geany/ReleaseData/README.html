<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>ReleaseData assembles a collection of TerrrData archive files in manageable groups
of files. Manageable implies meeting two criteria: 1) sized to facilitate being
attached to emails without exceeding attachment size limits, 2) compressed and
grouped for easy extraction on the host computer receiving the released files.</p>

<p>The data files assembled by ReleaseData are limited to the actual .xlsx and .pdf
publisher territory files. If the documentation file PUB_NOTES_xxx.htlml
exists for any given territory, it will be released as part of the territory
data. None of the build files or processes that created the publisher
territories are included. Along with the publisher territory files, an
auxliary file named BuildDates.xlsx is released. This file is an Excel
spreadsheet containing the territory numbers, build names, and the date each
territory was generated.<pre><code>
    for example: 
        Terr150 Terr150_PubTerr.xlsx 2021-10-28
</code></pre>For details on how the BuildDates.xlsx is made see the
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/Build
Dates/README.html">BuildDates</a>
project documentation.</p>

<p>For each territory three files are included in the release. The files are
Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx, Terrxxx_SuperTerr.xlsx, and Terrxxx_PubTerr.pdf
where xxx is the territory number. The files with the .xlsx name extension are
Excel spreadsheets, the file with the .pdf name extension is a printable PDF
file.</p>

<p>A fourth file may be included with a territory. If present, 
PUB_NOTES_xxx contains notes for territory xxx that the publisher should be
aware of, and will be included in the release.</p>

<p>The archive collection of territories is assembled in the Territories folder
/ReleaseData. This folder is organized with subfolders that follow the naming
convention 'Release_mm-dd-yy' where mm-dd-yy are the month, day and year the
release was built. The *tar utility is used to create the archive files, which
have the filename extension '.tar'. These are lovingly referred to as
"tarballs".</p>

<p>MakeReleaseData.tmp is the template makefile for the *make utility to perform
the build. The integrator will be required to preset the year in the makefile,
setting the 2-digit year in the var 'relyear'. All other makefile requirements
will be set by the DoSed shell parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note.</strong> Prior to using the *ReleaseData* build to generate a new
release of the territories, it is important to ensure that the publisher
territories have been constructed with data that is synchronized throughout
the data segment. The project
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/SyncAllData/README.html">SyncAllData</a>
is used to ensure synchronization.

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Build Results.</h3>

<p>Following are the results of the ReleaseData build process:</p>

<pre><code>
    Folder Territories/ReleaseData/Release_mm-dd-yy created if nonexistent

    in the above folder, the following files are created:

        Terr100-199.tar - dump of publisher territories 100-199
        Terr200-249.tar - dump of publisher territories 200-249
        Terr250-299.tar - dump of publisher territories 250-299
        Terr300-399.tar - dump of publisher territories 300-399
        Terr600-699.tar - dump of publisher territories 600-699.

    In addition the above .tar files, the following files are included
    in the release:

        BuildDates.xlsx  - spreadsheet itemizing each territory's build date
        README - ReleaseData project documentation
        RELEASE_NOTES - release-specific notes
</code></pre><br><a href="#IX">Index</a>
<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Setup.</h3>
Following is the build procedure for the ReleaseData project:

**Note.** Projects-Geany/BuildDates should be run prior to this build to ensure
BuildDates.xlsx is up-to-date.

**Note.** The Build menu item *Batch Move PUBNOTES* can be run prior to this
build to move all PUB\_NOTES\_xxx.html files to the TerrData folders. The
project shell BldNotesTIDList.sh can be used to build the NotesTIDList.txt file
that is processed by the *Batch Move PUBNOTES* build item.

ReleaseData Build menu:
<pre><code>
        edit 'sed' command line with month and day of the data release
        run 'sed' from the Build menu
        [run 'Make Dry-run' from the Build menu to verify parameters set
         correctly]
        run 'Make' from the Build menu to transfer all of the release data
         to the ReleaseData/ folder in territories
</code></pre>

<p>Once the build has gone through the *make process, the administrator should
update the BUILD_NOTES.md/.html file with the notes pertaining to this build.
This will be useful when the build is downloaded to a client system.</p>

<p>Extraction on target client system:<pre><code>
        ensure a directory structure exists that will be obvious as to its
         content of territory files (a good one is any that has 'Territories'
         as its lowest level folder 
        download the tarball files for the ReleaseData into the 'Territories'
         folder for extraction (or alternatively into a 'Downloads' folder)
        use an extraction utility that can handle .tar file formats and, if 
         necessary specify parameter(s) that will retain directory structure
         when the files are extracted</p>

<pre><code>    The territory data will now be stored in subdirectories Terrxxx for
     each territory xxx. Each territory will have 3 files:

    Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx - publisher territory (Excel)
    Terrxxx_SuperTerr.xlsx - super territory (Excel)
    Terrxxx.PubTerr.pdf - publisher territory (PDF)
</code></pre>

<p></code></pre><br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 File Contents.</h3>

<p>The target files built by MakeRelease are: </p>

<pre><code>
    AddressLookupInstructions.html
    BuildDates.xlsx
    README
    RELEASE_NOTES
    RELEASE_NOTES.html
    RELEASE_NOTES.md
    Terr100-199.tar
    Terr200-249.tar
    Terr250-299.tar
    Terr300-399.tar
    Terr600-699.tar</code></pre>

<p>Three file types make up the publisher files for any given territory. They
are named Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx, Terrxxx_SuperTerr.xlsx, and
Terrxxx_PubTerr.pdf where 'xxx' is the territory number. The Territory servant
may distribute any of these files to a publisher for working the territory.</p>

<p>Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx and Terrxxx_PubTerr.pdf contain the following information:</p>

<p>All the addresses, names, and phone numbers from 2 sources,
   Sarasota County Property Search, and RefUSA address search.</p>

<p>The files are formatted as follows:<pre><code>    </p>

<pre><code>5 lines of header information with basic information about the territory,
 and the date the publisher territory was generated. Included in this
 infomation is the city and zip code of the addresses. (See Letter-writing
 Territories below for exceptions).

line 6 through whatever contain the territory addresses and names with
the following column headings:
UnitAddress, Unit, H, Name(s), Phone1, RefUSA, DNC, FL, Personal Notes
</code></pre>

<p></code></pre> <br />
The files are tagged as "landscape format" with "grid", so if printed as much
information as possible will fit on the page. On most systems the "Personal
Notes" column ends up on its own page.</p>

<p><em>Column Descriptions.</em></p>

<pre><code> 
    UnitAddress - the street address
    Unit - for multiple-dwelling buildings, or apartments, the unit #
    H - a '*' in this column indicates "homestead"; that is, the owner
     is claiming homestead exemption with the county, so considers this
     their permanent address
    Name(s) - name or names of residents; only county records will have
     multiple names in one record (see "Name Grouping" below)
     if this is a DoNotCall 'DO NOT CALL' will appear in the Name(s) column
    Phone1 - left empty if the publisher wishes to add a phone # found
     via one of the people search engines
    RefUSA - the phone number listed with RefUSA for this address; if there
     is no phone number in RefUSA it will read "Not Available"
    DNC - if set to '1' this is a DoNotCall
    FL - if set to '1' this is a Foreign-Language DoNotCall</code></pre>

<p>If the record information came from the Sarasota County Property search, the
record text will be in all uppercase (e.g. 800 THE ESPLANADE N).<br>
If the record information came from the RefUSA search, the record text will
be in mixed case (e.g. 800 The Esplanade N).</p>

<p><strong>Name Grouping</strong>.</p>

<p>Resident names are grouped in two ways. If the county data lists multiple
owners, all of the owner names appear in one cell, in uppercase, and separated
with commas (e.g. SMITH JOSEPH, SMITH MARY). If the property is owned by a
trust, often the secondary name(s) will be trustees. If the property is H='*'
homestead, likely one or more RefUSA names will match the trustees.</p>

<p>For RefUSA records, the names are one per record. If multiple residents are in
the RefUSA data for the same address, each resident will have their own line
of data.</p>

<p>If a given address has territory records on more than one line, the first line
of information is the first one encountered for the address. That line will be
highlighted in green. Subsequent lines that belong with the same address will
have the Unit column highlighted in blue. This makes it much easier to see all
the residents for one address. If there is county data for the address likely
(but not always) it will be the first line for the address, will have data in 
all uppercase, and highlighted green.</p>

<p><strong>Letter Writing Territories.</strong></p>

<p>Letter/phone territories are numbered in the 600s and are formatted somewhat
differently from other territories. The territory information in the header may
contain multiple zip codes, since that is the way that Territory Servant is set
up. When Territory Servant is allowed to randomly assign addresses to a letter
writing territory, the addresses may cross multiple zip codes. When a letter
writing territory spans zip codes, each address line contains the zip code at
the end to avoid using the wrong zip code. Letter writing territories have the
same column headings as other territories. Otherwise, the formatting and 
highlighting are the same as for regular territories.</p>

<p><strong>Super Territories.</strong></p>

<p>Super Territories are included with every regular and letter writing
territory. They are always in spreadsheet (Excel) files, and are best
used from a laptop, notebook, or desktop computer since most mobile
devices that can use spreadsheets do not have the full spreadsheet
functionality of following hyperlinks. (Hyperlinks are special cells that
can redirect the user to a web page or another file).</p>

<p>All Super Territories have the filename Terrxxx_SuperTerr.xlsx, where
'xxx' is the territory number. The spreadsheet file has two tabs, 
Terrxxx_PubTerr and Terrxxx_Search. The first tab, Terrxxx_PubTerr,
contains identical information to that in the Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx
spreadsheet. It is the "standard" publisher territory information.</p>

<p>The second tab, Terrxxx_Search, has the column headers rearranged along
with some additional columns. The columns in this sheet are:
H, Address, Unit, Name, Phone1, RefUSA, fastpeople, truepeople, 411, DNC, FL
The fastpeople, truepeople and 411 columns contain hyperlinks to enable
quick lookup for each address. (See the Hyperlinks segment below).</p>

<p>The following are the individual column descriptions/explanations:</p>

<p>H - "homestead"; if a '*' is present, this address and the associated Name(s)
    are listed as homestead in the Sarasota County Property records. This 
    implies that this address is the permanent address of the owners, so
    the named person(s) should receive mail at that address year-round.</p>

<p>Address - the street address of the location.</p>

<p>Unit - for addresses with units (condos, apartments, duplexes, etc) this
    is the unit #</p>

<p>Name - the name(s) of the residents; if uppercase (e.g. DOE JOHN) it is
    the owner name(s) from the SCPA county data; if mixed case (e.g. John Doe)
    it is the name from the RefUSA data. Note that names in the county
    are usually lastname first, from RefUSA are firstname first.</p>

<p>Phone1 - left blank; may be filled in by using hyperlink data. (See the 
    Hyperlinks segment below).</p>

<p>RefUSA - contains either the RefUSA listed phone number or "Not Available"</p>

<p>fastpeople - contains a hyperlink for searching www.fastpeoplesearch.com
    for this address; If you are using Excel, clicking on this cell will
    transfer you into your web browser to the 411.com website, with the
    address pre-loaded for you. (Some other spreadsheet packages like
    OpenOffice/Calc may require you to shift-click on the cell).</p>

<p>truepeople - contains a hyperlink for searching www.truepeoplesearch.com
    for this address; If you are using Excel, clicking on this cell will
    transfer you into your web browser to the 411.com website, with the
    address pre-loaded for you. (Some other spreadsheet packages like
    OpenOffice/Calc may require you to shift-click on the cell).</p>

<p>411 - contains a hyperlink for searching www.411.com for this address; If
    you are using Excel, clicking on this cell will transfer you into your
    web browser to the 411.com website, with the address pre-loaded for
    you. (Some other spreadsheet packages like OpenOffice/Calc may require
    you to shift-click on the cell).</p>

<p>DNC - if '1' this address/unit is in our Do Not Call list; As an added
    protection, the system places "DO NOT CALL" in the Name column.</p>

<p>FL - if '1', this is a foreign-language do-not-call</p>

<p><strong>Hyperlinks.</strong></p>

<p>In general a hyperlink is a special-case text that is a link to an external
source of information. Probably most are familiar with them in the JW
publications as blue-highlighted fields that may contain Bible verse links
or publication links (e.g. <font color="#000080">Is 55:8, w 02 23-24.</font>). In
the super territories they are links that your browser can follow directly to web
site information.</p>

<p>Hyperlinks to the 3 search engines, fastpeoplesearch, truepeoplesearch,
and 411 allow the user to jump directly into the desired search engine
without the tedium of typing in the address in the search engine search
dialog box. One "click" gets you directly there.</p>

<p>Most spreadsheet applications like Excel follow the convention of showing
hyperlinks as highlighted blue. In the Terrxxx_Search sheets the hyperlinks
are not highlighted, since they are "layered" under the text "Click here to
search".</p>

<p>Whatever column the "Click here to search" appears in, the hyperlink will
link out to your browser for the search engine listed in the column header
(e.g. fastpeople will link to fastpeoplesearch.com). The underlying
hyperlink supplies the search engine with a preloaded address field that
will send it directly to that information.</p>

<p>Many search engines are now protected with a layer of security that
precludes "robot" software from overloading the search engine. The first
time you visit one of these sites in your browser session, you may be required
to go through a verification to prove to the site that you are "human".
This usually involves checking a checkbox "I am human" and/or identifying
a series of pictures that follow a certain pattern (e.g. boats). Once you
have "passed", as long as your browser session remains active, you will
not have to repeat the "not-a-robot" verification for a given search engine.</p>

<p>Once through the "not-a-robot" verification you will be connected directly
to the address information for the site. By switching back and forth
between your browser window and your spreadsheet window, you can easily
compare information. The browser tab for the search engine/address will
remain active until you close it. Keep in mind that if you continue
clicking hyperlinks in the Super Territory, a new browser tab will be
opened every time you click a link. You may wish to do some periodic
"housekeeping" by closing browser tabs you are finished with.</p>

<p>THIS IS THE COOL STUFF: With a browser tab that is the web page for the search
information for a given address, all Windows-type operations may be performed on
the fields in the browser web page. This means that you can "copy" and "paste"
information from the web page back into your Terrxxx_Search sheet. You can cut
and paste additional phone numbers, names, or any other information into your
sheet for future reference. By saving the Terrxxx_SuperTerr.xlsx file, your
additions will be there whenever you wish to use them in the future.

<h3 id="5.0">5.0 Distribution.</h3>

<p>Once the build is complete, the entire set of files for the build are in the
development system folder ~/Territories/ReleaseData/Release_mm-dd-yy where mm,
dd, yy are the month, day, and year of the release. From there, the release is
ready for distribution.</p>

<p>The ReleaseData project folder has a shell <em>CopyToCloud.sh</em> that will upload all
of the release files to the folder CongInfoExchange/Terrritories/Release_mm-dd-yy
on the project coordinator's Google Drive. From there, the release files may be
downloaded onto the territory servants' computers.</p>

<p>The list of files included in the release are documented at the beginning of the
<a href="#4.0">File Contents</a> section above. The territory tarballs included in
the release may be extracted into folders and territories for distribution to
publishers. The <em>BuildDates.xlsx</em> file contains all of the build dates for the
territories, and will serve as a guide to the territories servants as to which
territories may need to be updated before distribution to publishers.

<h3 id="6.0">6.0 Macro Library.</h3>

<p><strong>WARNING: THIS SECTION IS FOR TECH-HEADS.</strong> (If you are not a "tech-head" this
is your introduction to the TechHead foreign language).</p>

<p>A macro library has been created for spreadsheet power-users that contains
macros that take the Release territories and massages them into finalized
publisher territories. The library name is "Release" and is an Apache OpenOffice
Calc library that can be imported into the installed LibreOfficeCalc on any
system.</p>

<p>The macro library is system-independent. It will run on either a Windows or
GNU/Linux system that has Apache Open Office/LibreOffice and Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) installed. Along with the macro library is a custom keyboard
configuration file that maps the user keyboard to the Release macro library. This
provides power-users with shortcut keys to manage the territory spreadsheets.</p>

<p>When included in a release, the macro library is contained in its own tarball.
This will require separate extraction on the target system, followed by
integration into the installed version of Calc. This is not a process for the
faint-of-heart. (Eventually tools will be developed to assist in this process.)</p>

<p>The macro library is maintained in the $folderbase/TerrRelease and the 
$folderbaseDocuments/GitHub/TerrRelease folders. To the <em>git</em> utility the 
GitHub/TerrRelease folder is 'origin', the ~Bill/TerrRelease folder is 'devel'.</p>

<p>Detailed documentation on the macro library is contained in a separate document,
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/ReleaseData/README-MACRO LIBRARY.html">README_MACRO-LIBRARY</a>.
