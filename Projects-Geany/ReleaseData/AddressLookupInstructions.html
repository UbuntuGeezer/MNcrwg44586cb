<h1>Venice North Territory / Address Lookup Instructions<br></h1>

<p><br>
This information is provided to enhance the name and address lookup process and has been carefully synched with our Regular Territory Maps. In other words, the territory boundaries are the same for our regular North Venice Territory Maps and these two enhanced lookup tools. These tools were designed in order to make it easier to determine who is most likely to live at the addresses in your territory. They can be provided at your request.<br>
<br>
You have been provided two Research Files for your territory. Both files contain all the addresses in your territory as well as names and phone numbers associated with the addresses.  This information is derived from two sources (Sarasota County Property Search and Sarasota Library Ref USA).   <br></p>

<ol>
<li>One file is a PDF (with the name ending in .pdf) and is Read-Only and print ready.</li>
<li>The second is an Excel spreadsheet (with the name ending in .xlsx) which allows editing and is not formatted for printing.  The Excel spreadsheet has special properties which are explained below.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong>  If you wish to print the territory spreadsheet, use the PDF spreadsheet to avoid
 printing extra pages which occurs when printing the Excel spreadsheet. <br>
<br>
The information provided on the spreadsheets is as follows:<br>
   • Territory number, date report generated, zip code, spreadsheet key<br>
   • All addresses in your territory (including unit numbers)<br>
   • <strong>H</strong> – If you see an asterisk ( * ), the owner is claiming a homestead exemption and this is considered their permanent address<br>
   • Address in <strong>ALL CAPS</strong> means the info is from the <em>Sarasota County Property Appraiser</em> website<br>
   • Address in <strong>Mixed Case</strong> letters means the info is from <em>Sarasota Library RefUSA</em><br>
   • Phone Numbers: provided by RefUSA or left empty so you may enter a phone number you have researched<br>
   • <strong>Do Not Calls</strong>: Noted with a 1, DNC or FL for Foreign Language<br>
   • <strong>Green</strong> Shading: 1st line of a block with multiple names belonging to one address – use caution <br>
   • <strong>Blue</strong> Shading: additional lines of names belonging to one address – use caution<br>
   • <strong>PDF</strong> Spreadsheet (Terr...PubTerr.pdf): you may print this and write on the document<br>
   • <strong>Excel</strong> Spreadsheet (Terr...PubTerr.xlsx): you may save this electronically and enter information into the spreadsheet. This document is not formatted for printing.<br>
<br></p>

<h2>Further Detail for Those Comfortable with Electronic Spreadsheets<br></h2>

<p>The Excel spreadsheet (file ending with .xlsx) is a Super Territory and has two tabs.  <br></p>

<ol>
<li>Spreadsheet on tab 1 has all the information provided above.</li>
<li>Spreadsheet on tab 2 has hyperlinks.  The hyperlinks direct you to FastPeopleSearch.com, TruePeopleSearch.com and 411.com.  The website may require that you verify that you are not a robot.  This is normal.  A new browser tab will open every time you click a hyperlink, and you may wish to close out extra browser tabs periodically.</li>
</ol>
