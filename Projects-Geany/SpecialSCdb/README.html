<p>Special territories have anomalies that hamper straight-forward extraction of the
records from the RefUSA or SCPA sources. Examples are territories that
use streets as boundaries where one side of the street is in one publisher
territory and the other side of the street is in a different publisher territory.
Another case is where both sides of the street, but different segments of the
street, are in different territories. If a long street serves as the boundary
for several publisher territories different segments and different sides of the
street may be in several different territories. Territories that have any of
these characteristics are referred to here as "complex" territories.</p>

<p>Complex territory streets pose a unique set of challenges in separating download
data into the correct territories. To meet this challenge "special" download
databases are supported that allow downloading all addresses for a single street
(or area) into one database. Then each address within that database is tagged
with which territory it is assigned into. Databases which contain this type of
records are termed "special" databases. Territories which utilize segments of
streets have a property "Segmented" in their TerrIDData definition. Defining
these segments are discussed in the documentation for
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/Territories/FL/SARA/86777/RawData/RefUSA/RefUSA-Downloads/Special/README.html">RefUSA-Downloads/Special</a></p>

<p>document.</p>

<p>Because of using two sources for publisher territory data, there are two types
of "special" databases; those that contain county data and those that contain
RefUSA data. For consistency it is wise to define the county and the RefUSA
databases with matching names to facilitate identification. Wherever practical
the county data should be considered the "master" for the special data. By doing
this, the RefUSA data can then be more easily harmonized with the owner data in
the county special database.</p>

<p>The county special database should be defined and reconciled for accuracy before
defining the RefUSA special database. This makes for much easier coordination of
the publisher territory records between the county and RefUSA data. For further
information on setting up RefUSA special databases see the
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/SpecialRUdb/README.html">SpecialRUdb</a>
project documentaion.</p>

<p>The SpecialSCdb project takes a special SC download .csv and
creates a .db that can be used for building territory-specific special dbs.
The .csv and its associated .db will reside in folder 
~/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Special. The special SC download .csv records are
full records from the SCPA download.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE.</strong> Once the /Special/&lt; special-db > has been built, each
territory using it must have a set of files specific to that territory
to incorporate the &lt; special-db > records into its Terrxxx_SC.db. The file
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/SpecialSCdb/SPECIAL.html">SPECIAL</a> with this project documents this
process.</p>

<p>The primary build target of the project is the database &lt; special-db >.db
that will reside in the ..SCPA-Downloads/Special folder. The makefile
MakeSpecialSC.tmp provides the template for the actual makefile, with
provision for specifying the &lt; special-db > name for the build.</p>

<p>SpecialDBsc will build the &lt; special-db >.db from a <special-db>.csv that
is the SC download from SCPA. It will build 3 tables, the first being the
extracted records of full download data from the current Terr86777.db
table Terr86777. A query coded by the user will extract the appropriate
records from Ter86777 into a .csv file. The .csv file will then be imported
into a table by the same name as the database, <special-db>. Once imported,
a territory ID field will be added to each record, allowing easy extraction
of records for any given territory.</p>

<p>The second table is created with the following SQL:</p>

<pre><code>--create PropTerr table with account#, location name + location  street, terrid.;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a legacy table, currently used by congregation number 86777 Capri Isles
(?) territory Bridle Oaks (possibly others). This table may be eliminated since
the first table now contains the TID field for extracting territories.</p>

<p>The third table is the <em>TerrList</em> table that contains the list of
territories which have records in the &lt; special-db > table, along with
the count of records for each territory. This provides an index of
territories which are affected whenever the &lt; special-db > database is
updated. Since SCPA records all have unique property IDs, the TerrList
table can be most accurately build by searching all territory SCBridge
tables for the property IDs. When this table is populated, corresponding
records in the &lt; special-db > table will also be updated with the territory
id.</p>

<p>The fourth table is the <em>Spec_SCBridge</em> table that contains the basic unit
dwelling address information in Bridge format for easy extraction into
Specxxx_SC.db databases for each special territory.</p>

<p>Once the .csv data has been downloaded with the data from the SCPA<em>mm-dd.db
download, its table is modified on-the-fly adding one additional field "TID".
For each record, this field will contain the territory ID of the territory
the record belongs in. Each territory which references records from this
<special-db> database will extract its own records into its own download
folder. Specxxx</em>SC.db will be the standardized name in each territory
download containing "special" records from any set of <special-db> databases.</p>

<p>Some of the SC polygons span territories because of the way the parcel
boundaries fall on the map. Their db tables can only be properly populated
when entire street(s) or a larger, covering, polygon is downloaded from
the SC data. One such case is territory 611 which is a letter/phone
territory covering Sawgrass. The download data table will always be
named the same as the .csv file the populates it (e.g. SawgrassPlus).</p>

<p>To facilitate allocating the SCPA records into the proper territory table(s)
the TID field in each <special-db> record will be set to the territory ID
of the territory it belongs in. These fields are populated by a query
in each SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder that uses the special db. The
standardized name fo that query is SetSpecTerrs.sql.</p>

<p>Fix611SC.sql and any similar post-download fix shells will now have the
flexibility to use "special" download databases to include/exclude
download records for street(s) in their territories. The "special"
databases that they will use are created by SpecialDBsc Build processes.</p>

<p>Any territory that requires special SC download processing will contain
a documentation file SPECIAL, similar to README for a project. The
SPECIAL file will contain the documentation of the special database(s)
(in folder /SCPA-Downloads/Special) that are required to correctly
generate the Terrxxx_SC.db/SCBridge table.</p>

<p>By implementing this, all territories that are "special" cases can be
handled the same way. A special SCPA extraction query will regenerate
the .csv whenever the SCPA full database is updated. The SpecialDBsc Build
will build/rebuild the special .db from scratch with the new data. It will
then be available for the UpdateSCDwnload Build to use when updating
the SC data for the territory.</p>

<p>SCSpecTerr_db.sql is the SQL source for this build. It will be run through
AnySQLtoSH to generate the shell that actually runs sqlite3 and creates
the <spec-name>.db. The optional file "preamble.s" for the territory will
contain any environment variables or other setup code that can be
appended to the AnySQLtoSH header_1 code when building the shell
for creating the special db. The SCSpecTerr.sql is saved in the SpecialDBsc
project directory.<br>

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Method.</h3>

<p>The project SpecialSCdb contains the necessary support objects when setting
up a special SC database. The database will be named after the principal
street or area covered (e.g. TheEsplanade.db). The special database will
reside in folder SCPA-Downloads/Special.</p>

<p>Steps below refer to "Methods" - how the data for the special database was
obtained.
To view the current Method documentation use the following link:
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/SpecialSCdb/README.Method.html">Method Documentation</a></p>

<p>The following steps should be performed in order when setting up a special
SC database: (Method 1 - records extracted from Terr86777.db,
Method 2 - records downloaded via SC Polygon)</p>

<pre><code>
Method 1:

    Create the query <special-db>.sql in the /Special folder to extract the
      correct records from Terr8677 (< special-db >.sql
      is the template). The extracted records are in file < special-db >.csv.
      The query also contains the SQL to take the extracted records and
      build the < special-db >, PropList, TerrList, and Spec_SCBridge tables
      from full SCPA download records. {SpecialSCdb}/Method1.sql is the
      template for this type of query.

    Create the "preamble" and "postamble" files < special-db >.hd1 and
      < special-db >.hd2 that contain the shell start/end code that will
      be included in the *SpecialSCdb*/SpecialSC_db.sh shell that builds the
      /Special/< special-db >.db

Method 2:

    Create the query < special-db >.sql in the /Special folder to take
     downloaded records from SCPA polygon map data <special-db>.csv
     and build the < special-db >\_SCPoly, PropTerr, TerrList, and Spec_SCBridge
     tables from the map download data. {SpecialSCdb}/Method2.sql is the
     template for this type of query.

Method 1 and 2:

Terminal Session:

    cd *pathbase*/Projects-Geany/SpecialSCdb to move to the *SpecialSCdb* project

    run DoSed to set up the *MakeSpecialSCdb* makefile with month and day of 
      Terr86777.db data that will be used.
      ./DoSed.sh < special-db > < month > < day >

    build < special-db > by running *make* on the *MakeSpecialSCdb* makefile
      make -f MakeSpecialSCdb

    use SQL db browser to verify
    [Since territory will be set in all records, if not all are in
     same territory, run SQL and clear the Special_SCBridge.CongTerrID
     fields]

    [this step is new as of 10/6/21.]
    The SQL < special-db >Tidy.sql should be implemented for territories
    which are almost totally dependent upon the Special database (like
    letter-writing territories with random addresses). This SQL will
    "tidy up" the < special-db >.db, setting the RecordDate and 
    RecordType fields in the Special_SCBridge table. This will only
    leave the "DoNotCall" fields unset. They will need to be be set by
    the MakeSpecials make for each territory.

    After the <special-db>Tidy.sql has been coded, it should be
    processed by (bashpath)AnySQLtoSQ and (bashpath)AnySQtoSH.
    run through the AnySQLtoSH project to generate its .sq shell
    statements, then it should be made into a .sh file for running
    the actual fixes into the <special-db>.db. Perform the following
    steps to finish "tidying" the new < special-db >.db:

        Using EaglePointTidy.sql as a template, code < special-db >Tidy.sql
        use ./DoSedAnyTidy.sh. < special-db > to set up the *make*
        run make -f Make.AnyTidy

    At this point < special-db >Tidy.sh has been built. To finish "tidying"
    the < special-db > records, run the < special-db >Tidy.sh

        ./< special-db >Tidy.sh
</code></pre>

<p>After the special database has been created and "tidied" in SCPA-Downloads/Special,
each territory using records extracted from that db will have to be set
up to process it. The processes and files for integrating the special db
data with the "regular" territory SC data all need to be defined in the
territory's SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder. See the following section for
details.<br>
<a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Territory Setup.</h3>

<p>The following steps should be performed in order when setting up a territory
to use one or more special databases:</p>

<pre><code>
    create parent special database using SpecialSCdb build procedures (see <a href="#2.0">above</a>)

{NewTerritory} project:
    follow <a href="file:///media/ubuntu/Windows/Users/Bill/Territories/FL/SARA/86777/Projects-Geany/NewTerritory/README.html">README</a> steps to create new territory folders if non-existent

Terminal: {SpecialSCdb} folder:
    [if "older" Special handling code is present in the territory folder
     run ClearSpecial.sh xxx, where xxx is the territory ID.]

<pre><code>run InitSpecial.sh xxx, where xxx is territory ID
</code></pre>

<p>Terminal: SCPA/Terrxxx folder:
    edit SpecxxxSC.sql to extract records from special database(s)
    replace $P1 with territory ID in MakeSpecTerrQuery
    edit the SELECT from SpecxxxSC.sql to edit RegenSpecDB.sqL to match
    edit the &lt; special-db > in MakeRegenSpecDB with Special db name
    edit SPECIAL and document the special dbs required for this territory
      and the records needed from each
    edit the &lt; special-db > in SetSpecTerrs.sql checking for anomalies and
      setting territory IDs, RecordTypes (clone from another territory
      like 288)
    check SyncTerrToSpec.sq for territory ID
    check MakeSyncTerrToSpec setting territory ID and &lt; special-db >
    edit MakeSpecials with the &lt; special-db ></p>

<pre><code>[run make -f MakeSpecials --dry-run to check setup]
run make -f MakeSpecials to setup SC special territory data.

<h3 id="6.0">6.0 Significant Notes.</h3>

<p>BUG: The <special-db> queries that extract the special recordset from
VeniceNTerritory.db may miss some valid addresses/properties that were
not picked up when the database was originally built in July of 2020.
This was discovered with the SCPA_08-25.db build from the 8/25/2021
full download from the county, when missing addresses in territory 311
were not able to be picked up.</p>

<p>The interim solution is to have the Special queries extract records from
the latest SCPA full download, as opposed to VeniceNTerritory.db. This 
way at least the records will be integrated into the territory Bridge
tables, even though missing from VeniceNTerritory.db</p>

<p>The best solution is to come up with a better way of updating the
VeniceNTerritory.db after a new download, since the differences can
only focus on property IDs already known in the NVenAccts table of
VeniceNTerritory.db.<br>
