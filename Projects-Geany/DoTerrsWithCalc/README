<h3 href="1.0"> 1.0 Project Description.</h3>
DoTerrsWithCalc implements the code required to process QTerrxxx.csv
files by placing a list of the territory IDs in a Calc spreadsheet. Then
The user can execute a macro from the Territories macro Library to
process the list by opening each file and running the necessary additional
macros to process the QTerrxxx.csv into a Terrxxx_PubTerr.ods and
Terrxxx_SuperTerr.ods.

The goal is to be able to use DoTerrsWithCalc as a repeated process to
generate territories from a list of territory IDs (such as what is in
Territory Master). This will enable batch processing of territories
whose QTerrxxx.csv's have been updated awaiting Calc processing into
publisher territories.

**Basic Macros.**<br>
This project depends upon the macros described below.
<pre><code>
OpenQTerr.bas - Open QTerrxxx.csv from Working-Files for territory xxx.
SaveCsvToODS.bas - Save .csv file to .ods workbook.
QToPubTerr3 - Build PubTerr sheet from download QTerr data.
QGetToBridge - Build Bridge sheet from download QTerr data.
BridgeToTerr3 - Build PubTerr sheet from Bridge sheet.
InsertQTerrHdr - Insert territory sheet header into download data.
MoveToDocSheet - Move to document/sheet from different document/sheet.
FinishTerritory - (future) Untitled PubTerr to _PubTerr.ods, _PubTerr.xlsx, _PubTerr.pdf
SuperTerritory - (future) _PubTerr.xlsx to _SuperTerr.xlsx, _SuperTerr.ods

<h3 href="3.0">3.0 Significant Notes.</h3>
Much of the prototype code development is initially done in macros defined
in ProcessQTerrs12.ods. This is done to avoid having to continually export
the Territories Library in order to preserve code changes over Calc crashes.

The drawback is that any code that jumps into the Territories Library,
then returns may lose continuity due to Territories Library vars being
released. This has the side-effect that code may have to be migrated
into the Territories Library in order to be accurately tested for
functionality.

Main subs/macros - DoTerrWithCalc - called with xxx territory ID
>  to take territory xxx QTerrxxx.csv and make a territory workbook
Terrxxx_PubTerr.ods

DoTerrWithCalc uses the QTerrxxx.csv file as its basis for
generating the resultant territory. The QTerrxxx.csv file was generated
by runniing a query on the territories SQL database to extract the
records for territory xxx. Once that has been done, the SQL processing
is left behind, and LibreOffice/OpenOffice Calc is used to finish
generating the territory in spreadsheet and PDF formats for the publishers
to use.

The sub/macro QGetToBridge takes the download data from the .csv file
and creates the Bridge sheet which contains all the base records for the
territory. The Bridge worksheet is taken as input to the BridgeToTerr sub
that creates a territory worksheet in the QTerrxxx.ods workbook.

Once the territory worksheet has been created in QTerrxxx.ods, it is
exported to the Terrxxx_PubTerr.ods. From there, it is further saved as
an Excel formatted workbook and a PDF formatted file for ease of use
by publishers.
