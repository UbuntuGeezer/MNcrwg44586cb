Project Description.
--------------------
WARNING: BEFORE RUNNING THE BUILD FOR THIS PROJECT: be sure to go through
the steps and run the SCNewLetter project build AND create an empty
Terrxxx_RU.db by initializing and using an empty Mapxxx_RU.csv.

The RUNewLetter project creates a database that emulates the database
created by the RUNewTerritory_db.sh within Terryyy RefUSA-Download folder.
Since letter-writing territories span zip codes and areas throughout the
congregation territory, the RU build is a special case of the SPECIAL
build process for any RU territory.

Rather than starting from a Map download and adding records from the
Special dbs, the starting point is an empty Map download with records
being placed in the Terrxxx_RU.db via the SyncTerrToSpec process
embedded in MakeSpecials.

Dependencies.
-------------

NewLetter.sql - SQL to create new Terryyy_RU.db and populate from Letteryyy_TS.csv

Terryyy_RU.db - empty new database with same structure as any Terryyy_RU.db

MakeSpecials - makefile to build the Specyyy_RU.db then use it to populate
  the Terryyy_RU.db

AddZips.sql - template for AddZips.sql specifically for Terryyy; DoSed will
  copy this to the Territory RU-Downloads folder with the territory edited in

MakeAddZips - makefile for AddZips.sql to AddZips.sh for Terryyy; DoSed will
  copy this to the Territory RU-Downloads folder with the Territory edited in
  
  
Method.
-------
The primary letter writing territory data comes from the territory PDF
file. This file is first processed into an SC letter writing territory
in the SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder.

To ensure accuracy, all letter writing RU territory data is taken from
Special RU data downloads, since the letter writing addresses are scattered
all over the congregation territory.

To create a new letter-writing RU territory follow the instructions for
the RefUSA-Downloads/Terryyy portion in the SpecialRUdb project build
documentation file SPECIAL. In particular, the MakeSpecials makefile will be
principally responsible for integrating the RefUSA-Downloads/Special database
extractions with the Terryyy_RU.db.Terryyy_RUBridge records.

The Terryyy_RUBridge records table should initially be empty, since there
is no expedient way to download scattered letter writing address data. The
MakeSpecials makefile will build Specyyy_RU.db from the Special databases,
then insert those records into Terryyy_RU.db.Terryyy_RUBridge using the
SyncTerrToSpec shell.

Becuase of these dependencies, the entire RU letter-writing territories
process depends heavily on 1) the accuracy of /RefUSA-Downloads/Special
databases with RU record extractions of areas/streets, 2) the accuracy
of the RegenSpecDB.sq query in gathering the records from the Special
databases, and 3) the accuracy of the recipe in MakeSpecials for building
both the Specyyy_RU.db and synchronizing its records with the Terryyy_RUBridge
records in Terryyy_RU.db.

Since the Special databases are nearly mirrors in SC and RU /Special folders,
the RegenSpecDB.sq code for RU can be cloned from the SC version with a 
few modifications.

Setup.
------
Perform the following steps to build the RUNewLetter project for a territory:

Projects-Geany/SCNewLetter - perform the build for this first, creating an
	empty Terrxxx_RU.csv for generating an empty Terrxxx_RU.db.


RUNewLetter Build menu:

	edit 'sed' Build menu command line and set the territory ID as parameter
	run 'sed' from the Build menu; this sets up the MakeRUNewLetter makefile
	[run 'Make Dry-run' from the Build menu to test the makefile]
	run 'Make' from the Build menu to generate the Terrxxx_RU.db

Terminal: SpecialRUdb project folder:

	"freshen" the SPECIAL db processing files by:
	  run ./ClearSpecial.sh <terrid> to remove older versions of files
	   SPECIAL, SpecxxxRU.sql, RegenSpecDB.sql, SetSpecTerrs.sql,
	   SyncTerrToSpec.sql, MakeSpecials

	 run ./InitSpecial.sh <terrid> to load the critical files to the
	  RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder

Terminal: RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder:  
	 use gedit to edit the above files to match territory ID; only MakeSpecials
	  needs to be edited, but it isn't a bad idea to edit the others with
	  the date and territory ID

	run make -f MakeSpecials --dry-run to validate the makefile execution
	run make -f MakeSpecials to initialize the Specxxx_RU.db and
	 Terrxxx_RU.db databases

	check MissingIDs.csv for records missing property IDs; if the file
	 length is > 0 bytes, investigate whether those records are legiitmately
	 ignored; if not, edit FixyyyRU.sql with fixes, then use the FixAnyRU
	 project to build FixyyyRU.sql.sh; run FixyyyRU.sh to fix the records

The Specxxx_RU.db and Terrxxx_RU.db are now up-to-date and ready for use
with the BridgesToTerr project.
