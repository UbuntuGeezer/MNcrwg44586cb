Special Databases.
------------------
Territory 626 depends upon 6 special download databases resident in the folder
Territories/RawData/.../RefUSA-Downloads/Special:

	Bellagio.db
	EaglePoint.db
	HiddenLakes.db
	SawgrassS.db -  Sawgrass South RU download
	SawgrassN.db -	Sawgrass North RU download
	WaterfordNW.db

Besides the Special databases, 626 letter also depends on:

	Terr232_RU.db
	Terr272_RU.db

Territory 626 is a letter writing territory. Territory Servant randomly assigns
addresses from the territory, so they are not in any particular street or area
order. There may be some even and some odd addresses for any given street. For
these reasons, the only way to accurately extract records from a special download
is by using the Terrxxx_SC.db for the territory. BUT instead of using
Terrxxx_SCBridge,the table to be used is Terrxxx_SCPoly, which was derived
from the actual Territory Servant list of addresses for the letter writing
territory.

The LOCATIONNAME, LOCATIONSTREET and LOCATIONDIRECTION fields from Terrxxx_SCPoly
assemble into a complete UnitAddress to be used for record selection from a
Special download database.

Following are the SELECT clauses for territory 626:

Terr626_SC.db as db11;
SawgrassS.db  as db29;

select * from db30.Spec_RUBridge 
where UPPER(TRIM(UnitAddress)) IN (SELECT LUnitAddr FROM a)
DETACH db29;

Since a special download database is only the RU data for a given street/area,
it may not contain any records for a given territory that depends upon it, since
the RU data is only "occupied" addresses.


Dependencies.
-------------
RegenSpecDB.sh - shell to rebuild and populate the Spec632_RU.db from the
  latest special download databases listed above.


Processing.
-----------
When an update is done to territory 632, RegenSpecDB.sh will be invoked
by the UpdateRUDwnld make/build. RegenSpecDB.sh will rebuild the local
Spec632_RU.db by copying the Bridge records from the special download
databases that belong to territory 632. The Spec632_RU.db will then be
ready for use whenever it is needed.

The Spec632_RU.db entries need to be integrated into the Terr632_RU.db prior
to running the BridgesToTerr makefile on territory 632. The shell SyncTerrToSpec
merges the Bridge records from Spec632_RU.db into the Terr632_RU.db After the
merge has been completed, if duplicate records are present, only the lastest 
are retained.

The make for the UpdateRUDwnld project has been modified to include both the
RegenSpecDB and SyncToTerrSpec shell executions if they are present in the
Terr632 RU download folder.


Setup.
------
The SpecialRUdb project contains all the tools necessary to take a special
download from RefUSA-Downloads/Special and move the .csv records into
a database named after the .csv. A special download, say vvvvv.csv is
the extracted records from a RefUSA polygon for given street or area.

RU-Downloads/Special
The creation of the /Special/vvvvv.db involves several steps.
	SpecialRUdb Project:
	Build menu; enter territory ID and vvvvv name into "sed" item
	execute "sed" from the build menu
	execute "Make" from the build menu, creating vvvvv.db
	[the tables created in vvvvv.db are documented in SpecialRUdb/README]

RU-Downloads/Terr632
	copy files SPECIAL, RegenSpecDB.sq, SyncTerrToSpec.sq, MakeRegenSpecDB.tmp,
	  MakeSyncTerrToSpec.tmp, Spec632RU.sql, MakeSpecTerrQuery, MakeSpecials to Terr632
	  folder by running the shell InitSpecial.sh from the SpecialRUdb project

	edit SPECIAL in the territory download folder to document the special
	  databases and procedures for generating the territory

	edit Spec632RU.sql to properly extract the RU data from the <special-db>
	  that applies to territory 632
	edit MakeSpecTerrQuery to run on territory 632
	run "make" in the territory download folder to execute the query and
	  generate the initial Spec632_RU.db database

	edit the names of any Special databases into the RegenSpecDB.sq file
	  ATTACH statement(s) to complete customizing the process for the territory.
	run "make" in the territory download folder to generate RegenSpecDB.sh shell
	  the MakeRegenSpecDB makefile
	use "sed" to change "<filename>" to "RegenSpecDB" in RegenSpecDB.sh
	[RegenSpecDB.sh will be run by the UpdateRUDwnld project]

	edit SetSpecTerrs.sql setting the territory ID and special db names
	edit MakeSetTerrs makefile setting the territory ID

	run "make" in the territory download folder to generate SetSpecTerrs.sh shell
	  with the  MakeSetSpecTerrs makefile
	use "sed" to change "<filename>" to "SetSpecTerrs" in SetSpecTerrs.sh

	run "make" in the territory download folder to generate SyncTerrToSpec.sh shell
	  using the MakeSyncTerrToSpec makefile
	use "sed" to change "<filename>" to "SyncTerrToSpec" in SyncTerrsToSpec.sh

	run RegenSpecDB.sh in the Terr632 folder

	run SetSoecTerrs.sh in the Terr632 folder

	run SyncTerrToSpec.sh in the Terr632 folder

	edit MakeSpecials and remove .PHONY qualifier to activate makefile
	ensure territory ID and database(s) names are all set for downstream call
	 whenever any upstream database is updated

	run "make" -f MakeSpecials to complete the setup of the Spec632_RU.db
	 and the updating/synchronizing of the data in Terr632_RU.db and
	 any /Special/ .dbs with the territory

Following the "make" operation, RegenSpecDB.sh, SetSpecTerrs, and
SyncTerrToSpec.sh are ready to be run, in order, by MakeSpecials from
the territory download folder. This will complete the setup of all the
"special" database files that can now be automatically used by UpdateRUDwnld
when regenerating the territory records after either the special or
territory downloads.
