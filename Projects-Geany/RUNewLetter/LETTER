Territory xxx is a letter writing territory. Territory Servant randomly assigns
addresses from the territory, so they are not in any particular street or area
order. There may be some even and some odd addresses for any given street. For
these reasons, the only way to accurately extract records from a special download
is by using an empty Terryyy_RU.db as a placeholder. The SPECIAL processing for
territory yyy does the rest by running the MakeSpecials makefile to regenerate
the Specyyy_RU.db and synchronizing its records with the empty Terryyy_RU.db.
This fills the Terryyy_RU.db with the correct RU records for the territory.

Some letter-writing territories cross zip code boundaries. For these territories
an additional SQL must be created, AddZips.sql. The MakeSpecials makefile will
then contain a recipe to make AddZips.sh and incorporate an AddZips.sh call
into the recipe that creates Specxxx_RU.db to add zip codes to each address line
to avoid publisher confusion when using the territory.

All Special db dependencies are documented in the SPECIAL document file.

Setup.
------
The RUNewLetter project contains all the tools necessary to create the
framework for a letter-writing territory. RUNewLetter creates an empty
Mapxxx_RU.csv, then generates an empty Terrxxx_RU.db as a placeholder.

From there, all that is necessary is for the SPECIAL processing to run.
That process will create Specxxx_RU.db with all the RU records for the
letter-writing territory, then synchronize the special records into
Terrxxx_RU.db.

RU-Downloads/Special
Create the necessary /Special/vvvvv.dbs for the territory.
The creation of the /Special/vvvvv.db involves several steps:
	SpecialRUdb Project:
	Build menu; enter territory ID and vvvvv name into "sed" item
	execute "sed" from the build menu
	execute "Make" from the build menu, creating vvvvv.db
	[the tables created in vvvvv.db are documented in SpecialRUdb/README]

Terminal: From the RUNewLetter project
	run ./InitLetter.sh <terrid> with the <terrid> of the territory
	this will copy both the LETTER documentation and the .pdf source for
	the letter territory to ~/RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx

RUNewLetter project:
	Build menu: edit "sed" command line with the <terrid> of the territory
	run "sed" from the Build menu to set up MakeRUNewLetter makefile
	run "Make" from the Build menu to create the new/empty Terrxxx_RU.db

SpecialRUdb project: enter the project and follow the Setup steps to
complete setting up the letter writing territory RU data.
