<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>FixTerrSQLs is a "reliability" project that goes through a list of territories
then processeS each territory's folder .sql files
and batch edits them to be consistent with all SQL queries for a given
Territory system. The most obvious is to ensure the SQL is using the
environment variable <em>pathbase</em> in all file referencing operations like
.open,.import.,.output and ATTACH. The single build uses <em>sed</em>, <em>awk</em> and
<em>cat</em> to modifify the .sql files in a specific folder (typically a territory
download or Geany project folder.</p>

<p>The project will also be used when creating new congregation Territory
systems. There are over 1,000 .sql queru files within a Territory system, many
of which have path dependencies on the <em>folderbase</em>, <em>basepath</em> and
<em>congterr</em> environment variables. Whenever these system-wide environment
variables are changed, the downstream SQL queries and shell files will be
affected. FixTerrSQLs, especially the FixAllSQLs shell, facilitates rapidly
editing all affected SQL queries.<br>

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Setup.</h3>

<p>FixTerrSQLs consists of "stand-alone" shells that fix .sql and .psq files.</p>

<pre><code>
FixTerrSQL.sh fixes a single territory folder.
    Usage. bash FixTerrSQL.sh < terrid > < basepath > [< ru sc >]. < terrid > is the
     territory ID; < basepath > is the base path (e.g. *pathbase*/RawData);
     [< ru | sc >] where present, is the file downstream folder type ru | sc.

FixTerrPSQ.sh fixes .psq files in single territory folder.
    Usage. bash FixTerrPSQ.sh < terrid > < basepath > [< ru sc >]. < terrid > is the
     territory ID; < basepath > is the base path (e.g. *pathbase*/RawData);
     [< ru | sc >] where present, is the file downstream folder type ru | sc.

FixAllTerrSQLs.sh fixes .sql files in all territory folders in the TIDList.txt list files on the < path >.
    Usage. bash FixAllTerrSQLs.sh <path>
     < path > is the full path to the base of the folders
      (e.g. *pathbase*/RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads )

FixAllTerrPSQs.sh fixes .psq files in all territory folders in the TIDList.txt list files on the < path >.
    Usage. bash FixAllTerrSQLs.sh <path>
     < path > is the full path to the base of the folders
      (e.g. *pathbase*/RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads )
