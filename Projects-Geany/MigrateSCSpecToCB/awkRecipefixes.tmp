# awkRecipefixes.txt - Fix SPECIAL makefile ".sh" generation recipe.
#	11/25/22.	wmk.
#
# awkRecipefixes contains the *mawk* directives to correct the main build menu
# recipe for creating a ".sh" file from a ".sql" file. *mawk* searches for the
# comment "*P1.sh primary" which starts the recipe block. (Standardized code
# used within SPECIAL makefiles). It then replaces all following lines in the
# makefile with the content of "MakeRecipe.txt" from the MigrateSCSpecial
# project folder.
