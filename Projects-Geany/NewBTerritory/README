Project Description.
--------------------
NewBTerritory sets up the RawData, TerrData folders and creates the
Working-Files/Terrxxx TerrxxxHdr.csv for new business territory xxx.

The initial folders created are:
	BRefUSA-Downloads/TErrxxx
	BRefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx
	BRefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx/Previous
	BSCPA-Downloads/TErrxxx
	BSCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx
	BSCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx/Previous

The above folders are only created after testing for their existence.
 
To create empty Map downloads in order to initialize the territory,
use MakeEmptyBRUMap and MakeEmptyBSCMap.

Setup.
------
Several steps are involved in creating a new business territory:

	Define the territory boundaries and basic information in the TerrIDData.db.
	 This includes the territory number, DoNotCalls, area name, optional
	 subterritories, zip code and status. The territory header information
	 is taken from this databsase.
	
	edit the territory id into the "sed" item in the Build menu
	run "sed" from the Build menu to set up the makefile for building
	 folders for the territory.
	 
	run "Make Dry Run" from the Build menu to check the setup.
	
	run "Make" from the Build menu to build the initial territory folders.
	 The initial folders are named TErrxxx so they appear first in the
	 file folders under RawData for SCPA and RefUSA. This makes the folders
	 stand out for receiving territory download data.

	run Calc on TerrData/Terrxxxhdr.csv to create Terrxxxhdr.ods
	
	use RefUSA to define and save the download polygon for the territory
	download the RefUSA polygon data into the Downloads folder
	rename the download Mapxxx_RU.csv
	move/copy the download to the TErrxxx folder under BRefUSA-Downloads
	rename the folder Terrxxx so it is in its proper place in the system
	update the SystemTracker.Territory Master List sheet with the date
	 of the download, as well as the RefUSA Downloads sheet
	
	use SCPA Property Search map to define the download polygon for the
	 territory. There is no mechanism within SCPA to save the polygon.
	download the SCPA polygon data into the Downloads folder
	rename the download Mapxxx_SC.csv
	move/copy the download to the TErrxxx folder under BSCPA-Downloads
	rename the folder Terrxxx so it is in its proper place in the system
	update the SystemTracker.Territory Master List sheet with the date
	 of the download, as well as the SCPA Downloads sheet
	[Note. Some territories have only 1 SCPA record (e.g. mobile home
	 parks). For these, run MakeEmptySCMap.sh from the Procs-Dev folder
	 to create an empty SC map.]
	
	move to the SCNewBTerritory project to guild the Terrxxx_SC.db
	set the build commands and run make

	WARNING: The RUNewBTerritory project depends upon SCNewTerritory having
	 run first!
	move to the RUNewBTerritory project to build the Terrxxx_RU.db
	set the Build commands and run make
