Project Description.
--------------------
UpdtRULetter regenerates the key dbs for a letter-writing territory. The
Build process does the following:

	Cycles the previous RU letter database to ./Previous
	
	Clears the Terrxxx_RU.db.Terrxxx_RUBridge records, but preserves the
	 empty table
	
	runs Make on the MakeSpecials makefile in the territory download folder
