<h2>Project Description.</h2>

<p>The AddSCBridgeRecord project adds a new record (likely missing/omitted
from all previous SC downloads) to the Terrxxx_SC.db table Terrxxx_SCBridge.
The user must supply the property ID of the record to add, and the
territory ID of the territory in which to add the record.</p>

<p>The Terr86777 table has as the primary key the property id (Account #), so
the new record will only be added if a record exists in Terr86777 for the
specified property ID. The record with the matching property ID will be
extracted and the appropriate fields added to the Terrxxx_SCBridge table
for territory xxx.</p>

<p>If this was a missing property, likely the AddTerr86777Record project will
have been used to add the missing property into Terr86777 prior to doing
the build for this project.</p>

<h2>Setup.</h2>

<p>Perform the following steps to add a new record to Terrxxx_SCBridge
for territory xxx:</p>

<pre><code>Documents:
   focus on README or README.md document to enable *Run It* in Build menu

Build Menu:
   edit *sed* command with property ID and territory

   run *sed* from the Build menu

   run *Make* from the Build menu (builds the .sh)

   run *Run It* from the Build menu
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note.</strong> <em>Run It</em> is used instead of putting the command in the <em>Execute</em>
Build menu command, since there is a bug in chromeos <em>make</em> that displays
html for the Execute instead of actually executing it..</p>

<p>Also note that this will add a duplicate record if the property ID record
already exists in Terrxxx_SCBridge.</p>
