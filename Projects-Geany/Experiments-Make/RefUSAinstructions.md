Reference Solutions (formerly RefUSA) is a data collection tool that allows
the user to get names, addresses, etc. from a nationwide datbase. It is much
more efficient than "white pages" apps, in that it allows collection from
an area, as opposed to a single address. Within this documentation it will
simply be refered to as RefUSA.

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 RefUSA Dependencies.</h3>
To access RefUSA you need a current library card to any public library system
in the U.S. that has access to the RefUSA system. Your access to RefUSA is through
the public library system. (At present, no direct private log-ins are supported in
RefUSA).

In addition, you will need a device (preferably a computer) that has a web
browser. A computer or tablet is recommended, as smaller devices do not have
sufficient display screen area to effectively use RefUSA.

Also, your library system must have web-page access and an interface of links
to external sites. In particular, your library must have a link to the
Reference Solutions website of DataAxle.

For best use, your device should have storage space to allow you to download
RefUSA data so that you may repeatedly access it locally without having to
re-do your search(s) on RefUSA. Your web browser should have its target folder
for downloading files in its "Settings".

	 re-enter your library card number (accepting terms of use)
