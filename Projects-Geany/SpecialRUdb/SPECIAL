Special Databases.
------------------
With the support of <state> <county> <congno> Territory systems, a new system-wide
envionment var has been defined. *pathbase* uses the *folderbase* environment var
to define the territory path base as $folderbase/Territories/<state>/<county>/<congno>
where <state> is the 2-character state abbreviation, <county> is the 4-character
county abbreviaion, and <congno> is the congregation number.

Territory xxx depends upon 2 special download databases resident in the folder
*pathbase*/RawData/.../RefUSA-Downloads/Special:

** special RU dbs.**
--* InnerDr.db - all Inner Dr addresses in Colonial Manor
--* OuterDr.db - all Outer Dr addresses in Colonial Manor

Following is a sample SELECT clause for territory xxx:
Terr 267 set in all CongTerrID fields in both databases.

non-MHP Special select.
WITH a AS (SELECT OwninigParcel AS Acct
 FROM db11.Terr237_SCBridge)
INSERT INTO Spec_RUBridge
SELECT * FROM db29.Spec_RUBridge
CongTerrID IS '267';
DETACH db29;

Since a special download database is only the RU data for a given street/area,
it may not contain any records for a given territory that depends upon it, since
the RU data is only "occupied" addresses.


Dependencies.
-------------
RegenSpecDB.sh - shell to rebuild and populate the Specxxx_RU.db from the latest special
  download databases listed above. This shell is tailored to each territory
  xxx and resides in ~/RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder.


Processing.
-----------
When an update is done to territory xxx, RegenSpecDB.sh will be invoked
by the UpdateRUDwnld make/build. RegenSpecDB.sh will rebuild the local
Specxxx_RU.db by copying the Bridge records from the special download
databases that belong to territory xxx. The Specxxx_RU.db will then be
ready for use whenever it is needed.

The Specxxx_RU.db entries need to be integrated into the Terrxxx_RU.db prior
to running the BridgesToTerr makefile on territory xxx. The shell SyncTerrToSpec
merges the Bridge records from Specxxx_RU.db into the Terrxxx_RU.db After the
merge has been completed, if duplicate records are present, only the lastest 
are retained.

The make for the UpdateRUDwnld project has been modified to include both the
RegenSpecDB and SyncToTerrSpec shell executions if they are present in the
Terrxxx RU download folder.


Setup.
------
The SpecialRUdb project contains all the tools necessary to take a special
download from RefUSA-Downloads/Special and move the .csv records into
a database named after the .csv. A special download, say vvvvv.csv is
the extracted records from a RefUSA polygon for given street or area.

CAUTION: The RegenSpecDB.sql for Mobile Home Park,s (MHPs) has been
implemented to depend upon the UnitAddress,s in the Terrxxx_SC.db. This
makes the RegenSpecDB processing identical for MHPs and letter/phone
territories. PRIOR TO EXECUTING RegenSpecDB.sh 'Export RU Data to SC'
must be run to set up the initial Terrxxx_SC.db from an existing MHP,s
Terrxxx_RU.db.

RU-Downloads/Special
The creation of the /Special/vvvvv.db involves several steps.
	SpecialRUdb Project:
	Build menu; enter territory ID and vvvvv name into "sed" item
	execute "sed" from the build menu
	execute "Make" from the build menu, creating vvvvv.db
	[the tables created in vvvvv.db are documented in SpecialRUdb/README]

RU-Downloads/Terrxxx
	copy files SPECIAL, RegenSpecDB.sq, SyncTerrToSpec.sq, MakeRegenSpecDB.tmp,
	  MakeSyncTerrToSpec.tmp, SpecxxxRU.sql, MakeSpecTerrQuery, MakeSpecials to Terrxxx
	  folder by running the shell InitSpecial.sh from the SpecialRUdb project

	edit SPECIAL in the territory download folder to document the special
	  databases and procedures for generating the territory

	edit SpecxxxRU.sql to properly extract the RU data from the <special-db>
	  that applies to territory xxx
	edit MakeSpecTerrQuery to run on territory xxx
	run "make" in the territory download folder to execute the query and
	  generate the initial Specxxx_RU.db database

	edit the names of any Special databases into the RegenSpecDB.sq file
	  ATTACH statement(s) to complete customizing the process for the territory.
	run "make" in the territory download folder to generate RegenSpecDB.sh shell
	  the MakeRegenSpecDB makefile
	use "sed" to change "<filename>" to "RegenSpecDB" in RegenSpecDB.sh
	[RegenSpecDB.sh will be run by the UpdateRUDwnld project]

	edit SetSpecTerrs.sql setting the territory ID and special db names
	edit MakeSetTerrs makefile setting the territory ID

	run "make" in the territory download folder to generate SetSpecTerrs.sh shell
	  with the  MakeSetSpecTerrs makefile
	use "sed" to change "<filename>" to "SetSpecTerrs" in SetSpecTerrs.sh

	run "make" in the territory download folder to generate SyncTerrToSpec.sh shell
	  using the MakeSyncTerrToSpec makefile
	use "sed" to change "<filename>" to "SyncTerrToSpec" in SyncTerrsToSpec.sh

	[letter-writing territory]
	if this is a letter territory, code AddZips.sql to add zip codes to all
	 UnitAddress fields in Bridge tables used by this territory. The code
	 for this may be cloned from Terr626/AddZips.sql and should be saved
	 in the Terrxxx folder
	copy the MakeAddZips makefile from Terr 626 and edit for this territory
	run make -f MakeAddZips to make the AddZips.sh shell

	run RegenSpecDB.sh in the Terrxxx folder

	run SetSpecTerrs.sh in the Terrxxx folder

	run SyncTerrToSpec.sh in the Terrxxx folder

	[letter-writing territory]
	run AddZips.sh to add the zip codes to all UnitAddress fields

	edit MakeSpecials and remove .PHONY qualifier to activate makefile
	ensure territory ID and database(s) names are all set for downstream call
	 whenever any upstream database is updated
	if MakeSpecials is for a letter-writing territory, incude the prerequisite
	 and Make for AddZips.sh after the SyncTerrToSpec.sh call to add the
	 zip codes to the UnitAddresses in all the Bridge tables referenced
	 by the territory

Following the "make" operation, RegenSpecDB.sh, SetSpecTerrs, and SyncTerrToSpec.sh
are ready to be run, in order, from the territory download folder. This
will complete the setup of all the "special" database files that can
now be automatically used by UpdateRUDwnld when regenerating the territory
records after either the special or territory downloads.
