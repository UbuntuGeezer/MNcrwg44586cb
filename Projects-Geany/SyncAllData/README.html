<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>SyncAllData gathers together all the elements to synchronize all the data within
the data segement of the Territories system. The major components of the data
segment are the SCPA raw data, RefUSA raw data, and the TerrData publisher
territories. Whenever new data is downloaded from either the SCPA or RefUSA
source, this automatically makes some, or all, of the TerrData publisher
territories out-of-date. This project synchronizes all of the data segment
elements to bring them up-do-date with the latest download data.
<a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Data Segment Components.</h3>

<p>The data segment consists of 3 major components; the SCPA raw data, the RefUSA
raw data, and the TerrData publisher territory data. Before proceeding with
the details here, familiarize yourself with the
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/DocumentationCB/ManagingTerritoryData.html">Managing Territory Data</a>
document.</p>

<p>The principal component of the data segment is the SCPA raw data. This is the data
upon which the publisher territories is most dependent since it is the property
ownership records. The RefUSA data is supplementary to the SCPA data, as it
is the "current residency" data. The TerrData publisher territories are built by
merging these two data sources.</p>

<p>The foundation for the synchronization dependencies used by this project is 
understanding how the data is obtained from the SCPA and RefUSA sources, then
merged for the TerrData publisher territories.</p>

<p>All data for the congregation assigned territory is placed in a unique folder
system for each county that the congregation assigned territory covers. The
folder system for each county is named Territories/&lt; state >/&lt; county >/&lt; congno >
where &lt; state > is the 2-character state abbreviation, &lt; county > is the
4-character county abbreviation, and &lt; congno > is the congregation number.
This allows a congregation's assigned territory to span several counties,
or even several states.</p>

<p>Since North Venice congregation's assigned territory is entirely contained
within Sarasota County, only one folder system is needed, namely,
Territories/FL/SARA/86777. The code and data segments are all stored under
this parent folder.</p>

<p><strong>SCPA Raw Data.</strong><br>
The source of the SCPA raw data is the Sarasota County Property Appraiser
records. This data is downloaded enmasse from the county property appraiser's
website. Each download of county data is given a unique name to enbale history
tracking. The download data from Sarasota County is a massive Excel workbook
containing the property records and all associated conversion tables for
coded fields within the records. This data is then converted to a database,
then further pared down to consist only of properties within the congregation
territory boundaries. The "paring" process is dependent upon a huge amount of
prior work that determined all of the county property IDs within the congregation
assigned territory. (This was done using a huge polygon superimposed upon the
county property aerial map.)</p>

<p>The congregation territory master database of county records is the database
Terr86777.db. From there the data is separated out into the territories that
the congregation territory servant has defined. Each territory has its own
folder of files for county data. The county data for any given territory is
on the path RawData/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx where 'xxx' is the territory
number.</p>

<p><strong>RefUSA Raw Data.</strong><br>
The source of the RefUSA raw data is the <em>Reference Solutions</em> (formerly
Reference USA) databases. These databses are only accessible through public
library systems (like Sarasota County Digital Library). The residential
database is a well-maintained "white pages" directory of residents by
street name and municipality.</p>

<p>Most of the RefUSA data is obtained by drawing polygons around residential
map areas, then downloading the information for all residents within the
polygon boundaries. This is quite convenient for getting publisher territory
names and addresses, since the polygons can be drawn to correspond to the
congregation territory maps. Each territory has its own folder of files for
RefUSA data. The RefUSA data for any given territory is on the path
RawData/RefUSA/RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx where 'xxx' is the territory number.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions.</strong><br>
The data segment makes provision for cases where polygon-derived data either
misses some addresses, or where a street has segments in more than 1 territory.
Both the RefUSA and SCPA folders contain an additional folder /Special. The
/Special folder has download data and databases that are street or area
organized.</p>

<p>One example of a street with segments in multiple territories is Park Blvd S.
This street is the boundary for 8 territories where often addresses that are
across the street from each other are in different territories. The map
polygons will either let you extract data from one or the other, or both,
sides of the street, but there is no way to tell from the polygons what the
first and last house numbers are for the polygon using the street as a boundary.</p>

<p>The data segment /Special is set up to download all addresses on that street
(Park Blvd). Then special processing is set up for the database which contains
all of the street addresses to assign ranges of addresses on the street to
different territories. This provision is in both the SCPA and RefUSA data.</p>

<p>Each /Special street or area has 1) a .csv file named for the street/area that
contains the download data for the street, 2) a .db database of records for
the street, 3) a "make" file that rebuilds the publisher territory database
for each territory that uses information from the /Special .db database.

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Data Segment Database Heirarchy.</h3>

<p>DB-Dev/Terr86777.db is the master database for the congregation territory system.
This database is ALWAYS updated first as it is the county ownership records for
all properties within the congregation territory boundaries. Following is the
dependency heirarchy for all data within the data segment:</p>

<pre><code>
    Master database: DB-Dev/Terr87666.db
    |
     -  Special databases: SCPA-Downloads/Special/< spec-db >.db

          {SCPA-Downloads/Special/< spec-db >.db}
        -   {RefUSA-Downloads/Special/< spec-db >.db}

    -   Territory databases: SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx/Terrxxx_SC.db
            -[Terrxxx/Specxxx_SC.db]
            -Terrxxx/Terrxxx_SC.db

        Territory databases: RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx/Terrxxx_RU.db
            -[Terrxxx/Specxxx_RU.db]
            -Terrxxx/Terrxxx_RU.db

    -   Territory Generation datbases /DB-Dev/PolyTerri.db, MultiMail.db
            -/DB-Dev/PolyTerri.db
            -/DB-Dev/MultiMail.db

    -   Publisher Territories
            -TerrData/Terrxxx/QTerrxxx.db
</code></pre>

<p>As shown in the heirarchy list above, there are essentially 3 tiers to the data
segment. The first tier is all of the download data; the second tier is databases
containing all records for building publisher territories; the third tier is the
publisher territories themselves.</p>

<p>The relationships between the databases, both within tiers and across tiers,
is extremely complex. To maintain the integrity of the relationships without
using an extraordinarily complex database schema, the relationships are
dynamically defined by build dependencies. This simplifies the synchronization
of the data by being able to define the dependent relationships between whole
databases, as opposed to having to define the complex details of all the table
relationships across and within the databases.</p>

<p>Data downloads for just a single database may have a huge ripple effect on
multiple databases and territories within the Territories system. Each piece
of the data segment has its own build dependencies that are relevant to
its segment. To keep all the data synchronized, all that has to be known
is the downstream pieces that are affected. Synchronization then merely
involves letting each affected piece execute its own build dependencies.
<a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 Merging Territory Data.</h3>

<p>The Territories system provides tools and utilities in the code segment that
merge the SCPA and RefUSA data into one set of records that has all of the
information from both sources. This merged set of records is placed in the
DB-Dev folder in two databases: PolyTerr.cb and MultiMail.db. When a publisher
territories are generated, the data is extracted into a separate TerrData folder
for each territory.</p>

<p>For territories using "special" databases, the special records that pertain to
each territory are included in the territory folder /Terrxxx (where 'xxx' is
the territory number) residing in either the SCPA or RefUSA data segment.</p>

<p>The heirarchy for merging territory data into a publisher territory
is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
    SCPA master database Terr86777.db
    SCPA Special territory database(s) < special-db1 > .. < special-dbn >
    RefUSA Special territory database(s) < special-db1 > .. < special-dbn >
    SCPA territory database Terrxxx_SC.db
    RefUSA territory database Terrxxx_RU.db
    PolyTerri.db and MultiMail.db databases along with
      /TerrData/Terxxx/Working-Files/QTerrxxx.db
    /TerrData publisher territory spreadsheets and PDF files
</code></pre>

<p>Once the territory data has been merged into the QTerrxxx.db for the publisher
territory, it is processed into publisher territory spreadsheet and PDF files.</p>

<p>The above heirarchy provides the order of prerequisites for determining if a
publisher territory is out-of-date. The databases along the heirarchy chain
have associated .csv or .db files. If the .db file is older than a prerequisite
.csv file or .db file it is dependent on, then the .db file is considered
out-of-date.</p>

<p>The *make* utility is the tool used for keeping the databases up-to-date. It
is a general purpose project management utility that provides the means to
"build" targets that become part of an integrated system. While its most common
use is for building applications that are "executable" files from source and
binary files, it is used for the Territories system to integrate the data
segment files into publisher territories. When any portion of the data segment
that affects a publisher territory is updated, *make* cascades the update
through the data segment heirarchy to update the publisher territory.</p>

<p>The *make* files (makefiles) that build and update the data segment databases
are defined and maintained in "projects" that are organized under the Geany
project management system. All projects within the Geany project management
system are considered part of the code segment. The code segment is documented
in detail in the
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/DocumentationCB/ManagingTerritoryCode.html">Managing Territory Code</a>
documentation.</p>

<p>The makefiles within the code segment define build chains that construct target
files from prerequisite files. A target file is considered out-of-date if any
of its prerequisite files are newer. For the Territories system, files that are
further "down" the heirarchy are target files that use files "up" the heirarchy
as prerequisites. In addition, files at a given level of the heirarchy may have
their own prerequisites that they depend upon for being built. Databases that
are target files generally have comma separated value (.csv) files or other
database (.db) as prerequisites.</p>

<p>The Territories system uses *make* on a complex system of makefiles that
enforce the heiarchy of the data segment files to ensure that each publisher
territory is properly updated whenever new data affecting that territory is
downloaded. The "last stop" in the build sequence for any publisher territory
is the generation of the publisher territory files PubTerrxxx.xlsx,
SuperTerrxxx.xlsx, and PubTerrxxx.pdf from the QTerrxxx.csv file.</p>

<p>The QTerrxxx.db, PolyTerri.db, and MultiMail.db files are all updated within
one build  process, with the PolyTerriDB.db and MultiMail.db files
as prerequisite files for generating the QTerrxxx.csv file.
<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 SyncAllData Build.</h3>

<p>The SyncAllData build process primarily uses one complex makefile, MakePubTerr.
That makefile is invoked for each territory and enforces
the heirarchy described in the preceding section. "Special" territories have
complex build prerequisites that are derived from the SpecialDBs.db databases
residing within the RefUSA-Downloads/Special and SCPA-Downloads/Special folder.</p>

<p>The build process heirarchically invokes other projects to accomplish
synchronization. It also runs *make* on makefiles within the SyncAllData
project. Synchronization is accommplished territory-by-territory by the
MakePubTerr makefile running shell files, other makefiles within SyncAllData,
and other projects' makefiles.</p>

<p>The order of reference to other projects within the MakePubTerr makefile is
as follows:<pre><code>
   UpdtSpecSCBridges - updates Special SC databases with new Terr86777 data
   SpecialRUdb - create Special RefUSA database
   UpdateSCBridge - update territory SC database with new Terr86777 data
   UpdateRUDwnld - update territory RefUSA database with new Mapxxx_RU.csv data
   BridgesToTerr - merge SC and RU records for territory into main dbs,
    extract records to TerrData/Working-Files QTerrxxx files
   DoTerrsWithCalc - use spreadsheet ProcessQTerrs12.ods to generate publisher
    territory spreadsheets
</code></pre>
The MakePubTerr build process keeps track of out-of-date data segment pieces. If
the MakePubTerr encounters out-of-date pieces in any step preceding the
BridgesToTerr process, the build is exited and the user is prompted to run the
appropriate project(s) builds to bring the data up-to-date. It may be helpful
to review the
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/DocumentationCB/ManagingTerritoryData.html">Managing Territory Data</a>
documentation for the procedures to follow when this happens.

<h3 id="5.0">5.0 SpecialDBs.db Databases.</h3>

<p>It is important that the special databases for both SCPA and ReFUSA be as
closely synchronized as possible to each other, and that their dependent
territories are in sync with these databases. This is the second tier of
database heirarchy, just below the master database Terr86777. When any special
database is updated, it puts all the territories dependent upon it out-of-date.
The SCPA special datbases are higher in priority than the RefUSA databases,
since the RefUSA databases have fields that need to be synced with the county
data in the SCPA databases.</p>

<p>In most cases, there is a corresponding SCPA special database for each RefUSA
special database. The county SCPA data is considered the primary source of
information for each property within the congregation territory. This is because
the county data is the source of the ownership records for each property. This
mandates that the county data be updated first, then the RefUSA data by updated
and synchronized with the county data.</p>

<p>To simplify the maintenance of this heirarchy, special datbases are not "updated"
by changing out-of-date records. Rather, they are completely rebuilt from the
latest special download data. The projects SpecialSCdb and SpecialRUdb are
the engines that create special download databases. There are two ways to go
about synchronizing the SCPA and RefUSA special databases and their dependent
territories. One method is to ensure that the publisher territory build process
enforces each level of the heirarchy to be up-to-date before proceeding to the
next level of building the publisher territory. The second method is to store
synchronization dependencies in databases for the SCPA and RefUSA segments.</p>

<p>Build process synchronization is covered in the
<a href="#6.0">Making Publisher Territories</a> section below.</p>

<p>The critical information for database-driven synchronization is stored within
the SCPA-Downloads/Special/SpecialDBs.db and RefUSA-Downloads/Special/SpecialDBs.db.
Three tables within these databases contain interrelated records for each
&lt; special-db >.db. They are:</p>

<pre><code>
    DBNames - table of special database names
    OutOfDates - complete list of property IDs whose records are out-of-date
    TerrList - list of territories using each special database

DBNames:
    DBName - name of Special db (e.g. AuburnCoveCir.db)
    ModDate - last modification date from file system
    base_status - numeric identifier of database (always an even number)
    Status - current status of database; if = base_status the datbase is up-to-date
              if = (base_status+1) the database is out-of-date

OutOfDates:
    DBName - name of Special.db (same as in DBNames)
    PropID - county property ID of record newly downloaded
    Status - current status of record (linked to DBNames.Status)

TerrList:
    DBName - name of Specialdb (same as in DBNames)
    Terrxxx - folder name for dependent territory (e.g. Terr109)
    Status - current status of dependent territory (linked to DBNames.Status)
</code></pre>

<p>The "Status" field of both the OutOfDates and TerrList tables is keyed to the
"Status" field in the DBNames table. Whenever a &lt; spec-db > gets out-of-date
because of newly downloaded data, its Status field is set to its "base_status"
plus 1. That change is propagated downwards into the Out-of-Dates and TerrList
tables whose records are linked to that status.</p>

<p>It can be quickly determined which &lt; spec-db > databases are out-of-date from
the Status field of the DBNames table. If the Status belonging to the database
in the DBName field is odd, the &lt; spec-db > is out-of-date; if it is even, the
&lt; spec-db > is up-to-date.</p>

<p>A special database is considered out-of-date as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
    /SCPA-Downloads/Special/< spec-db >.db is older than /DB-Dev/Terr86777.db
    ../< spec-db >.db is older than its ../< spec-db >.csv

    /RefuSA-Downloads/Special/< spec-db >.db is older than /DB-Dev/Terr86777.db
    ../< spec-db >.db is older than its ../< spec-db >.csv
</code></pre><br><a href="#IX">Index</a>
<h3 id="6.0">6.0 Making Publisher Territories.</h3>
The steps for making a publisher territory that has fully synchronized data
are as follows:
<pre><code>
    in the SyncAlllData project run DoSed.sh to set up all of the synchronizing
     project files
      DoSed.sh mm dd < start-id > < end-id >

        mm = month of current SCPA download
        dd = day of current SCPA download
        < start-id > = starting territory ID for processing
        < end-id > = ending territory ID for processing

    run \*make\* on the MakePubTerr makefile</code></pre>

<p>This will invoke the database checking and build processes in the correct
heirarchical order to ensure that the publisher territory data is synchronized
across the master, SCPA, RefUSA and publisher territory databases.
<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="7.0">7.0 Synchronizing SCPA/Special Databases.</h3>

<p>An important step in keeping data synchronized is that of synchronizing special
databases. Next to the Terr86777 master SCPA database, the special databases are
the most important to have up-to-date. This is because many territories are
built from the data in special databases. The SCPA special databases must be
synchronized to the master SCPA database before synchronizing the RefUSA special
databases. This is because correctly rebuilding RefUSA special databases depends
upon the SCPA special databases being up-to-date.
<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="8.0">8.0 Synchronizing RefuSA/Special Databases.</h3>

<p>An important step in keeping data synchronized is that of synchronizing special
databases. Next to the Terr86777 master SCPA database, the special databases are
the most important to have up-to-date. This is because many territories are
built from the data in special databases. The SCPA special databases must be
synchronized to the master SCPA database before synchronizing the RefUSA special
databases. This is because correctly rebuilding RefUSA special databases depends
upon the SCPA special databases being up-to-date.
(See the <a href="#7.0">prior section</a>.)</p>

<p>Two tests are performed to check if a RefUSA special database is up-to-date.
The first test is checking that the RefUSA special database records are as new
as the file date of the .csv download file for the database. If the .csv file
is newer it implies that a download of RefUSA data has been performed, but the
special database has not yet been rebuilt from the latest download data. If the
special database is older than its latest .csv download, it should first be
rebuilt from the latest download before performing the second test.</p>

<p>The following steps sychronize all RefUSA/Special databases to their .csv
download files:</p>

<pre><code>
    cd $codebase/Projects-Geany/SyncAllData
    ls -lh $pathbase/$rupath/Special/*.db > $TEMP_PATH/RUspecDBs.txt
    export ix=1
    export csvname=dummy
    export csvdate=dummy
    . ./GetNextSpecDB.sh
    . ./setcsv.sh
    . ./SetCSVDate.sh $csvname
    ./DoSed1.sh $pathbase/$rupath/Special $csvname Spec_RUBridge
    ./SetAllDBcsvDate.sh $csvname   
</code></pre>

<p>The above operation proceeds through the Special/.db list of files one-at-a-time
by repeating the steps GetNextSpecDB througth SetAllDBcsvDate for the entire
list of /Special/.db,s.</p>

<p>The second test is to compare the RecordDate of its newest record with the
RecordDate of the newest record in the Terr86777 master database. If the county
database has a newer record, the RefUSA special database should be cycled
therough a new download and rebuild to ensure it is up-to-date.</p>

<p>The RefUSA databases should be newly downloaded and rebuilt every time there is
an SCPA county download. This is necesary since changes in ownership in the
county property records will likely trigger changes in the RefUSA occupancy
data. <br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>
