Project Description.
--------------------
AnySHtoSQL will take any .sh file and transform it into a SQL source file
.sql by the same filename. To do this 2 transformations take place: the
original .sh file is stripped to a sequence of "echo" commands that
will produce a file SQLTemp.sh containing all the shell/SQL from the original
file. This first transformation ends up on target file 'filename.sq'.
Then a second transformation takes the .sq file and strips the 'echo'
commands from each line to make the .sq file into an SQL source file with
name 'filename.sql'.

The transforms are all performed in a base folder name provided to the
make Build. The Build must be supplied with both the base folder name
and the base filename before it can proceed.

The .sh file is assumed to have the delimiting lines 
	# procbodyhere
	# endprocbody

awk 'BEGIN {p=0}; /&&&procbodyhere&&/ { p = 1 ; next }
           /&&&endprocbody&&&/ {p = 0; next };
           p { print }' file
Setup.
------
To convert any SQL to a shell, do the following:

Build Menu: edit the "sed" command line with the path and the .sql
 filename (without the .sql suffix)
 run "sed" from the Build menu to set up the makefile
 run "Make" from the Build menu to create the <filename>.sh

The <filename>.sh is now ready to either run from a command line or
from another shell.
