Project Description.
--------------------
RUNewBizTerr takes download data from the RefUSA records and creates a
database with the download records and Bridge table for territory generation.
The download records are assumed to be "map" download records from a
RefUSA business database in polygon record format.


Setup.
------
Perform the following steps from within the RUNewTerritory project:

??	WARNING: do the SCNewTerritory project first, since this project
	 depends upon the Terrxxx_SCBridge table when running InitialRUFix!

	ensure that Mapxxx_RU.csv is present in the BRefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx 
	 folder (use MvBDwnld.sh to move the .csv download from Downloads)

	edit the "sed" Build menu item with the territory ID of the new territory
	run the "sed" Build menu item
	
	run the "Make Dry Run" Build menu item to check for desired results
	
	run the "Make" Build menu item to generate the territory database
	

Raw Data Structure.
-------------------
Following is the table structure of the map polygon data. In the first
pass at generating territories, the "by shape" feature was used to draw
polygons on the RefUSA street map to obtain the addresses. The resulting
.csv download records all have the following SQL fields present:

CREATE TABLE Terrxxx_RURaw 
("Last Name" TEXT,"First Name" TEXT, "House Number" TEXT, 
"Pre-directional" TEXT,"Street" TEXT, "Street Suffix" TEXT, 
"Post-directional" TEXT,"Apartment Number" TEXT, "City" TEXT,
"State" TEXT,"ZIP Code" TEXT, "County Name" TEXT, "Phone Number" TEXT)

As can be seen from the table definition, the .csv fields are imported
directly into table Terrxxx_RURaw where xxx is the territory ID.

A provision has been made to take download data from RefUSA using entire
streets instead of polygons. This provision covers cases where entire
streets are necessary to have in a database, where the street spans two
or more territories. The SpecialRUdb project handles these databases.
Where a territory makes use of this provision, its raw data will contain
documentation in file SPECIAL, and a secondary database Specxxx_RU.db of
Special records in Bridge format for inclusion in the generated territory.
(See the SpecialRUdb project documentation README for further information.)


Significant Notes.
------------------
The Terryyy_RU.db UnitAddress fields are taken directly from the RefUSA
business listings with no modifications. As with non-business territories
these are in mixed upper/lowercase. However, unlike their counterparts in
non-business territories, the UnitAddress fields do not have multiple
spaces between the number and the street in the address field. For this
reason, ANY DO NOT CALLS RECORDED IN THE TerrIDData.DoNotCalls TABLE
MUST BE ENTERED EXACTLY AS THEY OCCUR IN A REFUSA BUSINESS DOWNLOAD.
