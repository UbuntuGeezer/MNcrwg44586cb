Project Description.
--------------------
FixAnySC takes the SQL postprocess query for any given territory and
builds it into a shell that can be executed by the make for UpdateSCBridge.
The execution of the FixyyySC.sh shell cleans up records which have missing
OwningParcel fields, to complete as many SC download records as
possible in the SCBridge table for the territory.

Polygon data is downloaded from SCPA Property Search into a separate .csv
file for each territory. The .csv filename is Mapyyy_SC.csv for any
territory yyy. The TerryyyRU.db is considered "out-of-date" if the 
SCPA-Downloads/Terryyy/Mapyyy_SC.csv file is newer than Terryyy_SC.db.

An "out-of-date" Terryyy_SC.db will be rebuilt in its entirety from the
the new download data in Mapyyy_SC.csv.


Setup.
------
To build FixyyySC.sh for a given territory yyy:

	Build Menu:
	'sed' - enter the territory ID in the sed build menu command line
	run 'sed' from the Build menu
	
	run 'Make Dry-Run' from the Build menu to test the build sequence
	
	run 'Make' from the build menu to make the Terryyy/FixyyySC.sh shell
	
Dependencies.
-------------
	hdrFixXXXSC.sh in folder ~/Procs-Dev
	FixyyySC.sql in folder ~/SCPA-Downloads/Terryyy


Build results.
--------------
	FixyyySC.sh in folder ~/SCPA-Downloads/Terryyy



Batched runs of FixAnySC.
-------------------------
The territory system has now matured to the point where multiple territories
may be downloaded at, or near, the same time. For each RefUSA polygon download,
its corresponding territory SC database needs to be brought up-to-date with
the current download information. The UpdateSCBridge project uses the "make"
utility to accomplish this. Part of that "make" process is to run FixyyySC.sh
after importing the records to handle exceptions in the download data.

Given the above, to facilitate the generation of multiple FixyyySC.sh files
with a single run, the FixAllSC.sh shell has been provided. While it resides
in the Procs-Dev folder, it is included with the FixAnySC project to keep
it bundled with the FixAnySC make facility.

FixAllSC.sh depends upon the file TIDList.txt resident in the FixAnySC project
folder. TIDList.txt provides FixAllSC.sh with a list of territory IDs for
which to run the MakeFixAnySC makefile. The shell loops reading the TIDList.txt
file, invoking DoSed and make for each specified territory. All that is necessary
is to execute the FixAllSC.sh shell (no parameters), typically from the Procs-Dev
folder.
