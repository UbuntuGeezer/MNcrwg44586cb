<h2>Project Description.</h2>
BuildSCDiff builds the "difference" database that collects the "changed"
records from the newest SC download, as compared with the previous
SC download. This difference database is then used to update the Terr86777
table in the Terr86777 db.
The difference database may then be used to update Bridge tables in any
territories that are "up-to-date" with the last SC download.

CAUTION: If the newest difference database is used to update a territory
that is not "up-to-date' with the latest SC download, the territory may
miss one or more intervening updates. If a territory is not "up-to-date"
with the latest SC download (difference), 2 options are available.
1) Run multiple updates on the territory SCBridge table using the past
differences (in sequence) that the territory is out-of-date with;
OR
2) Run a single update on the territory using the current Terr86777 data.

	Dependencies.
	-------------

Primary Target Dependencies.
----------------------------

The target SCPADiff_m2-d2.db is built from the BuildSCDiff make and has
dependencies on the following databases:

VeniceNTerritory.db	- territory master database containing all SC data
SCPA_m2-d2.db - SCPA download (latest) full database
SCPA_m1-d1.db - SCPA download (previous) full database

The SCPA_mm-dd.db databases are built directly from the SCPA full download
data. Their dependencies are:

	SCPA-Public_mm-dd.xlsx - .xlsx full download from SC site
	SCPA-Public_mm-dd.csv - .csv of all records from .xlsx download


Build Process Dependencies.
---------------------------
The build process has the following dependencies:

	bashpath -  variable defined pointing to folder with .sh files referenced
	SCDwnldToDB.sh - shell to process download .csv file to download .db
	
SCPADiff_m2-d2.db will be considered out-of-date if any of the .sql file
ExtractDownDiff.sql, the preamble file preamble.s, or the postscript files
hdrAnySQL.sh is newer.

If the hdrAnySQL.sh file is newer, the makefile MakeBuildSCDiff.tmp may
also be out-of-date. If this is true, a warning will be given the user and
the build stopped. This is because of the sensitivity of MakeBuildSCDiff.tmp
to the line count of hdrAnySQL.sh.

preamble.s is a series of shell statements that set up the following
environment variables that are embedded in the ExtractDownDiff.sql:
SCPA_DB1="SCPA_m1-d1.db"
SCPA_TBL1="Datam1d1"
SCPA_DB2="SCPA_m2-d2.db"
SCPA_TBL2="Datam2d2"
DIFF_DB="SCPADiff_m2-d2.db"
DIFF_TBL="Diffm2d2"
M2D2="m2-d2"


Build Process.
--------------

Perform the following steps to create an SCPADiff_m2-d2.db:

	move to the README file of the project; this will enable editing the
	 'No filetype commands' section of the Build menu
	edit the *sed ExtractDiff Build* Build menu command line with
	 m1 d1 m2 d1 of the old and new SCPA download dates
	 
	edit the *sed* Build menu command line with m1 d1 m2 d2 of the old
	 and new SCPA download dates

	run the *sed ExtractDiffBuild* Build command to modify
	 MakeExtractDiff makefile to build ExtractDownDiff.sh shell.
	Terminal session:
	 cdj BuildSCDiff
	 make -f MakeExtractDiff
	  to make the ExtractDownDiff.sh shell used by MakeBuildSCDiff

	Build menu: run 'Make' to create the SCPADiff_m2-d2.db, the 
	 differences database.

The differences database SCPADiff_m2-d2.db is now available for the
UpdateCongTerr project to use in updating the Territories Terr86777 table.
There is one more process to be run before the SCPADiff_m2-d2.db is
complete.

Add the DiffAccts table to the SCPADiff_m2-d2.db doing the following:

	SQL Browser:
	open the SCPADiff_m2-d2.db
	ATTACH  MultiMail.db as db3
	ATTACH  PolyTerri.db as db5
	
	copy the BuildDiffAccts.sql from the project into an Execute SQL tab
	execute the .sql with ctrl-r, F5 or any other method
	
	Browse Data in the DiffAccts table and review the affected territories
	 and property IDs
