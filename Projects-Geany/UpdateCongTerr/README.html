<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>The UpdateCongTerr project takes a given SCPA_mm-dd.db and uses it to update
the Terr86777 table within the Terr86777.db. This process will bring
the master SCPA territory records up-to-date with the SCPA_mm-dd.db download.</p>

<p>The sequence for going from SC county data to updating the Terr86777 table
within the Terr86777.db is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
    Download the data from the Sarasota County Property Appraiser's website.
    The data will reside in 'SCPA Public.xlsx'

    Use spreadsheet app to convert 'SCPA Public.xlsx' to the .csv file
        Datammdd.csv where mmdd is the month and day of the download

    Use the ImportSCPA project to import the data to the database
        SCPA_mm-dd.db

    Use the BuildSCDiff project to create the differences database
        SCPADiff_mm-dd.db
    containing the new records from the download compared to Terr86777 data

    Run SCNewVsCongTerr.sh to incorporate the "differences" records into
        SCPADiff_mm-dd.db

    Terr86777.db

<pre><code>
Web Browser:

    get into the county property appraiser's site and download the data
     for the entire county; the data should reside in a .csv file

UpdateCongTerr Project:

--- ImportSCPA Project...
</code></pre>

<p><a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/ImportSCPA/README.html">ImportSCPA</a></p>

<pre><code>
    create a new SCPA_mm-dd.db from the .csv data where mm, dd are the
     month and day of the download; add a DownloadDate field at the end
     of each record

    if this is the initial download of county data, create a database
     that only consists of records from the county that are actually
     within the congregation territory boundaries

    add a new table to the congregation territory db containing the county
     parcel numbers that are within the congregation territory boundaries
--- end ImportSCPA Project steps

    if this is not the very first download of data from the county,
     produce a "differences" database that contains the county records
     for any properties that have changed since the last download; criteria
     may be any of the columns "LastSaleDate", "HomesteadExemption"...
     This database will be named SCPADiffs_mm-dd.db with table named
     Diffsmmdd.

    insert/replace all records within the congregation territory db taken
     from the Diffsmmdd table 
</code></pre>

<h3 id="2.0">Build Sequence.</h3>

<p>The build sequence for updating the system-wide congregation territory
involves several steps. Each of these steps is discussed below.</p>

<pre><code>
    Download current county SCPA data
    Create a new SCPA_mm-dd.db
    Create a new differences database SCPADiff_mm-dd.db
    Update the territory master db Terr86777.db
</code></pre>

<p>Once the Terr86777.db database has been updated, all of the affected
territories in the SCPA-Downloads portion of the data segment should be
updated to incorporate the changed records. See the <a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/UpdateSCBridge/README.html">UpdateSCBridge</a> and <a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/FlagSCUpdates/README.html">FlagSCUpdates</a> project documentation for details on that process.
<p>When all of the territories in the SCPA-Downloads portion of the data
segment have been updated, the affected territories in the RefUSA-Downloads
portion of the data segment should be updated with fresh RefUSA download
data. See the <a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/UpdateRUDwnld/README.html">UpdateRUDwnld</a> project documentation for details on that process.
<p>Once all of the above processes have been completed, the congregation territory
has been fully updated. However, the affected publisher territories still need
to be regenerated. See the <a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/SyncAllData/README.html">SyncAllData</a> project documentation for generating
publisher territories.

<h3 id="2.0.1">Building SCPA\_mm-dd.db.</h3>

<p>A separate project <em>ImportSCPA</em> handles the creation of a new SCPA_mm-dd.db
from a new SCPA download. This should be the first step before proceeding
with the <em>UpdateCongTerr</em> project builds. Refer to the
 <a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/ImportSCPA/README.html">ImportSCPA Project</a> documentation.<br>
<a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="2.0.2">Building SCPADiff\_mm-dd.db.</h3>

<p>The <em>BuildSCDiff</em> project builds the SCPADiffs_mm-dd.db. This project build also be
completed create the SCPADiffs_mm-dd.db before proceeding with the <em>UpdateCongTerr</em>
project builds. Refer to that project documentation for details.
<a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/BuildSCDiff/README.html">BuildSCDiff Project README</a><br>
Once SCPADiffs_mm-dd.db is built /TerrData/OrphansIDs.csv has the Diffs table
entries for new records that do not have an associated territory ID. The
/TerrData/BuildPIDList.sh shell will build a list of these "orphaned" property
IDs in the file PIDList.txt. Running <br>
*bp/LoopAnyShell.sh ./idWhichTerr?.sh PIDList.txt<br>
will produce the file *TEMP_PATH/MatchedIDList.txt that contains a list of
property IDs and territories that have a close match to each property ID. This
list may then be used to manually enter territory IDs into the DiffAccts table
for property IDs not previously matched to territories.</p>

<p>AddSCBridgeRecord (and possibly AddTerr86777Record) may then be used to add the
record for the property into the appropriate Terrxxx_SC.db.Terrxxx_SCBridge
table and Terr86777.db/Terr86777 table.</p>

<p><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="2.0.3">Building the UpdateCongTerr Project.</h3>

<p>Once the SCPADiffs_mm-dd.db is in place, the UpdateCongTerr project can be started to finish
the task of integrating the differences into the congregation territory database. Since the
table containing the congregation territory records was initially named Terr86777, this project
inherited that name. The Terr86777 table is assumed to reside in the Terr86777.db.</p>

<p><strong>Note.</strong> See the 
 <a href="file:///home/vncwmk3/GitHub/NewTerritories/Documentation/Database Naming Conventions.html">Database Naming Conventions</a>
 section in the <em>Documentation</em> project for
documentation on the database naming conventions used throughout the Territories system.</p>

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Build Process.</h3>

<p>Note: The Build process incorporates an embedded CP-DBsToMirror shell call to back up the exiting primary databases (DB-Dev) to a mirror drive for recovery in case the build process hoses things up. The user may also wish to execute IncDumpMainDBs.sh from the ArchivingBackups project folder as a second-level line of defense for recovery prior to initiating the build.</p>

<p>The SCPA_mm-dd.db along with the differences database SCPADiff_mm-dd.db
are used to update the Terr86777 table in Terr86777.db.
The main target of this build is Terr86777.db.  SCPA_mm-dd.db is the full SCPA download and SCPADiff_mm-dd is the "differences" collection of records that have changed since the previous full SCPA download. Terr86777.db will be considered to be out-of-date if either of the prerequisite files is newer.</p>

<p>The XDiffsToCongTerr.sh shell performs the update. It is built off DiffsToCongTerr.sh by stream editing m2 and d2 to produce XDiffsToCongTerr.sh. It takes the SCPADiff_m2-d2.db table Diffm2d2 and updates the Terr86777 table by Inserting/Deleting entire records that have changed. This is more accurate than just doing an UPDATE of the Terr86777 records, since
multiple fields may have changed that are not being tested for.</p>

<p>The SCNewVsCongTerr.sql query differences the SC download with Terr86777. It is provided for reference to inspect what records will be changed. It may be run from the SQL user interface
or from the sqlite Database Browser. The utility shell DiffsPendingList.sh has been provided on the (bashpath) that produces a list of territories affected to ~/Documents/DiffTerrs.txt. <strong>NOTE: ON NON-PERSISTENT SYSTEMS THIS IS A TEMPORARY FILE ON VOLATILE STORAGE...</strong></p>

<p>To simplify usage, most menu items have been removed, but are documented below in case they need to be restored. To do the Build, all that is necessary is to edit the "sed" Build command in the Independent commands placing the month and day of the Diff file and prior downoad to use in the DoSed command. Then the <em>make</em> utility is run using the MakeUpdateCongTerr makefile.</p>

<p><strong>MakeUpdateCongTerr.</strong><br>
To update the Terr86777 table in Terr86777.db perform the following
steps:</p>

<pre><code>UpdateCongTerr project:
    Build Menu: edit the 'sed' command line 
     ./DoSed.sh m1 d1 m2 d2
        where m1 = month of previous download
        d1 = day of previous download
        m2 = month of current download
        d2 = day of current download

    run "sed" from the Build menu to set up MakeUpdateCongTerr,
      DiffsToCongTerr.sh, SCNewCongTerr.sql, BuildDiffAcctsTbl.sql
      Note: BuildDiffAcctsTbl is a leftover from previous build recipe

Terminal session:
    cdj UpdateCongTerr
    ensure environment vars *pathbase* and others are set

    [run "Make Dry Run" to check out the build prerequisites]

    run "Make" to update Terr86777 in Terr86777.db
     make -f MakeUpdateCongTerr
</code></pre>

<p>Once the Terr86777 table has been updated, log the update in the <em>Terr86777.db Updated</em> column of the SystemTracker."SCPA Main Downloads" sheet for recordkeeping purposes.<br></p>

<h3>Manual Terr86777 Update.</h3>

<p>To manually update Terr86777 from a given download and prior download
perform the following steps:</p>

<p>-- create and populate new SCPA_mm-dd.db</p>

<pre><code> Web Browser: SCPA Property Search.

    download the current SCPA data using the SCPA site "Downloads" to
     download today's SCPA data to file 'SCPA Public.xlsx', and change
     the filename to SCPA-Public_mm-dd.xlsx where mm and dd are the
     current month and date

    Calc: - folder SCPA/SCPA-Downloads open SCPA-Public_mm-dd-yy.xlsx
    use Calc to save the file as 'SCPA-Public_mm-dd.csv as a text .csv
     file that can be used by SQL to import all the data into a new .db

    SQL Browser:
    use SQL browser to create new database SCPA-mm_dd.db in SCPA-Downloads
     folder, empty with no table defined

    use Import from the File menu in SQL browser to import from csv file
     created by calc above; select 'header in first row' option; select 
     trim fields option; this trims blanks out of all the column names
     as well; name the table 'Datammdd' for the month and date of the
     download
</code></pre>

<p>-- create and populate a differences database SCPADiff_mm-dd.db</p>

<pre><code> run the QSCPADiff query to create a new empty database SCPADiff_mm-dd.db,
     extract a Diffm2d2.csv of difference records comparing SCPA_m1-d1.db against
     SCPA_m2-d2.db by recording records from the newer m2-d2 where the
     LastSaleDate or HomesteadExemption(YESorNO) field has changed from m1-d1,
     then importing those records into table Diffm2d2 in the new database
</code></pre>

<p>-- backup the exiting key databases to the mirror folder</p>

<pre><code> execute *procpath*/CP-DBsToMirror.sh
</code></pre>

<p>-- run the XDiffsToCongTerr shell to integrate the changed records into
    the Terr86777 table</p>

<pre><code>     ensure that the m1 d1 m2 d2 are properly set in XDiffsToCongTerr.sh by
     using DoSed from the UpdateCongTerr project to edit DiffsToCongTerr.sh

    execute XDiffsToCongTerr.sh from the project

    run sqlite on BuildDiffAcctsTbl.sql to update the DiffAccts table in
     SCPADiff_m2-d2.db with all territory IDs affected by this difference
     table; that list is obtained by grabbing CongTerrID fields from
     PolyTerri and MultiMail TerrProps and SplitProps tables where the
     OwningParcel is in the TerrID table.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="8.0">Significant Notes.</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As of 9/30/21 there is a bug in the build recipe that keeps running
QSCPADiff from the (bashpath), when the SCPADiff_mm-dd.db has already been
created/updated. The makefile has been modified to throw a fatal error when
this occurs. If everything else has beeen set up properly, enter the Terminal
and run DiffsToCongTerr.sh to force the update of Terr86777.Terr86777 records
around the makefile.
<strong>END NOTE.</strong></p>

<p>BuildDiffAcctsTbl.sh builds a DiffAccts table within SCPADiff_mm-dd.db that contains
all of the account #s and territory IDs for records in the Diffmmdd table. Any
records that are residential use, but not found in the main publisher territory
dbs (PolyTerri.db, MultiMail.db) have territory IDs >= 800 assigned. This allows
reporting and reviewing properties that should be assigned to publisher territories
but are not being picked up when publisher territories are run through BridgeToTerr.</p>

<p>BugFixes.sql contains queries that fix database bugs introduced by various updates.</p>

<p>As of 8/26/21 spaces in field names for Diffm2d2 table have been removed.
SCPA-mm_dd.db download fields, SCPADiff_mm-dd.db fields are now consistent with no
spaces in the field names. This is because downloads are now imported with
the "trim fields" option.</p>

<p>The Terr86777.db database still has the original space-filled field names,
so this is taken into consideration when the Terr86777 tables are updated.
This also helps differentiate field names when both Terr86777 and SCAPDiff_mm-dd
are open concurrently.</p>
