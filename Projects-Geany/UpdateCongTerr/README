Project Description.
--------------------
The UpdateNvenAll project takes a given SCPA_mm-dd.db and uses
it to update the NVenAll table within the VeniceNTerritory.db. This
process will bring the master SCPA territory records up-to-date with
the SCPA_mm-dd.db download.

Provision has been made within the project to create a new SCPA_mm-dd.db
from a new SCPA download. If a new SCPA_mm-dd.db is needed, perform
the following steps: (See the MakeCreateNewSCPA makefile instead of running
these steps manually).

	download the current SCPA data from the SCPA website; the download
	 file the site exports to is 'SCPA Public.xlsx'
	
	use Calc to load the downloaded .xlsx (this will take some time
	 as the download is approximately 84MB)
	
	Once the document is completely loaded, save the 1st worksheet as
	 a .csv file named 'Datammdd.csv' where mmdd is the month/day of the
	 download data

Build Process.
--------------
Note: The Build process incorporates an embedded CP-DBsToMirror shell
call to back up the exiting primary databases (DB-Dev) to a mirror drive
for recovery in case the build process hoses things up. The user may also
with to execute IncDumpMainDBs.sh from the ArchivingBackups project folder
as a second-level line of defense for recovery.


To update NVenAll perform the following steps:

UpdateNVenAll project:

	Build menu: edit the 'sed' command line in the build menu with the
	 month and day of the older download and the month and day of the
	 new download
	 ./DoSed.sh  mm dd
	
	run 'sed' from the Build Menu to edit all the UpdateNVenAll makefiles
	 and to set up the CreateNewSCPA.sql SQL directives

	run 'Make Custom Target.." from the Build menu to make 
	 CreateNewSCPA.sh to take SC raw download to SCPA_mm-dd.db
	 
Terminal: Projects-Geany/UpdateNVenAll folder:

	run ./CreateNewSCPA.sh to create SCPA_mm-dd.db with table
	 Datammdd; has exact match for columns in NVenAll, including
	 DownloadDate, but with no spaces in column names

Now that the SCPA_mm-dd.db is built, this project can build the
differences database SCPADiff_mm-dd.db and use that to update the
NVenAll table in VeniceNTerritory.db

The main target of this build is VeniceNTerritory.db. 
Its prerequisites are SCPA_mm-dd.db and SCPADiff_mm-dd.db, where
SCPA_mm-dd.db is the full SCPA download and SCPADiff_mm-dd is the
"differences" collection of records that have changed since the
prefious full SCPA download. VeniceNTerritory.db will be considered
to be out-of-date if either of the prerequisite files is newer.

The XDiffsToNVenAll.sh shell performs the update. It is built off
DiffsToNVenAll.sh by stream editing m2 and d2 to produce XDiffsToNVenAll.sh.
It takes the SCPADiff_m2-d2.db table Diffm2d2 and updates the NVenAll
table by Inserting/Deleting entire records that have changed. This is
more accurate than just doing an UPDATE of the NVenAll records, since
multiple fields may have changed that are not being tested for.

The SCNewVsNVenall.sql query differences the SC download with NVenAll.
It is provided for reference to inspect what records will be changed. It
may be run from the SQL user interface. A utility shell DiffsPendingList.sh
has been provided on the (bashpath) that produces a list of territories
affected to ~/Documents/DiffTerrs.txt. NOTE: THIS IS A TEMPORARY FILE
ON VOLATILE STORAGE...

To simplify usage, most menu items have been removed, but are documented
below in case they need to be restored. To do the Build, all that is
necessary is to edit the "sed" Build command in the Independent commands
placing the month and day of the Diff file and prior downoad to use in
the DoSed command.

MakeUpdateNVenAll.
To update the NVenAll table in VeniceNTerritory.db perform the following
steps:

	Build Menu: edit the 'sed' command line 
	 ./DoSed.sh m1 d1 m2 d2
		where m1 = month of previous download
		d1 = day of previous download
		m2 = month of current download
		d2 = day of current download

	run "sed" from the Build menu to set up MakeUpdateNVenAll,
	  DiffsToNVenAll.sh, SCNewVsNVenall.sql, BuildDiffAcctsTbl.sql
	  Note: BuildDiffAcctsTbl is a leftover from previous build recipe

	run "Make Dry Run" to check out the build prerequisites
	
	run "Make" to update NVenAll in VeniceNTerritory.db


MakeCreateNewSCPA.
MakeCreateNewSCPA is the makefile to create a new SCPA_mm-dd.db database
from the .csv data for the download date. The .csv data is merely a *Calc*
saved image of the SCPA-Public_mm-dd.xlsx download from the county.

   make -f MakeCreateNewSCPA

The preceding make creates SCPA_mm-dd.db in the SCPA-Downloads folder.
This *make* process has the Build menu item **Make Custom Target..**
linked to it, so it need not be run manually from Terminal in the project
folder.

Manual NVenAll Update.
----------------------
To manually update NVenAll from a given download and prior download
perform the following steps:

-- create and populate new SCPA-mm_dd.db

Web Browser: SCPA Property Search.

	download the current SCPA data using the SCPA site "Downloads" to
	 download today's SCPA data to file 'SCPA Public.xlsx', and change
	 the filename to SCPA-Public_mm-dd.xlsx where mm and dd are the
	 current month and date

Calc: - folder SCPA/SCPA-Downloads open SCPA-Public_mm-dd-yy.xlsx
	use Calc to save the file as 'SCPA-Public_mm-dd.csv as a text .csv
	 file that can be used by SQL to import all the data into a new .db

SQL Browser:	 
	use SQL browser to create new database SCPA-mm_dd.db in SCPA-Downloads
	 folder, empty with no table defined
	 
	use Import from the File menu in SQL browser to import from csv file
	 created by calc above; select 'header in first row' option; select 
	 trim fields option; this trims blanks out of all the column names
	 as well; name the table 'Datammdd' for the month and date of the
	 download

-- create and populate a differences database SCPADiff_mm-dd.db

	run the QSCPADiff query to create a new empty database SCPADiff_mm-dd.db,
	 extract a Diffm2d2.csv of difference records comparing SCPA_m1-d1.db against
	 SCPA_m2-d2.db by recording records from the newer m2-d2 where the
	 LastSaleDate or HomesteadExemption(YESorNO) field has changed from m1-d1,
	 then importing those records into table Diffm2d2 in the new database

-- backup the exiting key databases to the mirror folder

	execute (procpath)CP-DBsToMirror.sh

-- run the XDiffsToNVenall shell to integrate the changed records into
	the NVenall table
	
	ensure that the m1 d1 m2 d2 are properly set in XDiffsToNVenAll.sh by
	 using DoSed from the UpdateNVenAll project to edit DiffsToNVenAll.sh
	
	execute XDiffsToNVenAll.sh from the project

	run sqlite on BuildDiffAcctsTbl.sql to update the TerrID table in
	 SCPADiff_m2-d2.db with all territory IDs affected by this difference
	 table; that list is obtained by grabbing CongTerrID fields from
	 PolyTerri and MultiMail TerrProps and SplitProps tables where the
	 OwningParcel is in the TerrID table.

Significant Notes.
------------------
**NOTE:** As of 1/2/22 there is a bug in BuildDiffAcctsTbl.psq where it
is not generalized for multihost. The filepath /home/vncwmk3/ is welded
into the .open and ATTACH statements to force the correct pathing to the
databases. Also the CP_DBsToMirror.sh is being searched for in the 
/DB-Dev folder, so it is not run. For now, just depend upon the MainDBs
tar backup being current.
**END NOTE.**

**NOTE:** As of 9/30/21 there is a bug in the build recipe that keeps
running QSCPADiff from the (bashpath), when the SCPADiff_mm-dd.db has
already been created/updated. The makefile has been modified to throw
a fatal error when this occurs. If everything else has beeen set up 
properly, enter the Terminal and run XDiffsToNVenAll.sh to force the
update of NVenAll records around the makefile.
**END NOTE.**

BugFixes.sql contains queries that fix database bugs introduced by various
updates.

As of 8/26/21 spaces in field names for Diffm2d2 table have been removed.
SCPA-mm_dd.db download fields, SCPADiff_mm-dd.db fields are now consistent
with no spaces in the field names. This is because downloads are now imported
with "trim fields" option.

The NVenAll database still has the original space-filled field names, so this
is taken into consideration when the NVenAll tables are updated.
