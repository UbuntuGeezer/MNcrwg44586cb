Project Description.
--------------------
UpdateMHPDwnld facilitates updating all the Mobile Home Park (MHP)
records for any given territory within the MHP. A SPECIAL RU
download named <mhp-name>MHP.csv will contain the raw data from
the RefUSA download of the entire MHP, where <mhp-name> is the name of
the MHP (e.g. BayIndiesMHP.db). It is assumed that this download is the
current data.

When the UpdateMHPDwnld build is complete, the Terrxxx_RU.db has an
updated Terrxxx_RUBridge table that is ready for the BridgesToTerr
project to process into the master territory building databases.

MHP territories are all "special". The entire UpdateMHPDwnld process
depends upon all of the required databases and support shells being
present in the RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx folder.

The SpecialRUdb project documentation README and SPECIAL should be
followed carefully to construct the 
RefUSA-Downloads/Special/<special-db>.db database and the dependent
territories' Specxxx_RU.db and support files.

The InitSpecial.sh shell within the SpecialRUdb project will set up all 
the required files in the territory RU download folder. The InitSpecSed
project will perform the bulk of the editing required to set up the MHP 
territory as "special". If it is necessary to re-do all of the files
in the territory RU download folder, the Utility shell ClearSpecial.sh
will clear out all of the old files making way for InitSpecial to reload
the files for the territory.

Each MHP territory will contain a file <special-id>xxx.Streets.txt that
is the  old SQL select for extracting the territory records from the 
<special-db>.db in RefUSA-Downloads/Special. The current method depends
upon Terrxxx_SC.db having all of the UnitAddress,s for the MHP territory.

As of 11/2021, the MHP RU databases are built/rebult by running "make"
on the MakeSpecials recipe. UpdateMHPDwnld now uses that method in place
of regenerating the database with RUNewTerritory.

NOTE: The BuildBridges project has a utility to regenerate the Terrxxx_SC.db
database with pseudo SCBridge records corresponing to the MHP records
in Terryyy_RU.db.


Method.
-------

To update a mobile home park (MHP) territory that has been set up with SPECIAL
processing, perform the following steps:

RefUSA-Downloads/Special.
	
	Update the MHP Special download(s) by using RefUSA online to download
	 the latest .csv records for each .db

SpecialRUdb project.

	Build menu; open README and follow the Build Steps for SpecialRUdb
	 beginning with  edit Cycle Special DB command with <special-db>
	
	remove the current RefUSA-Downloads/Special/<special-db>.db (use the
	 Terminal within Geany)

	Follow the remaining steps to completion to update <special-db>; repeat
	 the preceding steps for each .db that the territory uses (typically
	 only one).

UpdateMHPDownload project.

	Build menu; edit the "sed" command line with the <special-db> and
	 territory ID
	run "sed" from the Build menu to setup the MakeUpdateMHPDwnld makefile
	
	run the "Make Dry-run menu item to check the make setup
	
	run the "Make" Build menu item to update the MHP download in the
	 territory


Build Processes.
----------------

There are several build processes within UpdateMHPDwnld:
	MakeRUMHP - adds the table Terrxxx_MHP cloned from Terrxxx_RUPoly to
				  the Terrxxx_RU.db
	MakeBuildSpecDB - creates the database RU<mhp-name>_mm-dd.db from
				  the MHP RU download .csv
	MakeUpdateMHPDwnld - creates anew the Mapxxx_RU.csv using a query
				  of the RH<mhp-name>_mm-dd.db records specific to
				  territory xxx
	MakeExtractOldDiffs - creates ExtractOldDiffs.sh to extract records
		from /Previous Terrxxx_RU.db where the previous UnitAddress is
		not present in the latest MHP download (see ExtractOldDiffs).
	MakeIntegrateOldDiffs - creates IntegrateOldDiffs.sh to integrate
		previous UnitAddress records back into Terrxxx_RU.db (see
		IntegrateOldDiffs).
		
MakeUpdateMHPDwnld.

	Dependencies.
		MakeRUMHP build process run sometime prior to ensure the presence
		 of the Terrxxx_MHP table within the Terrxxx_RU.db
		MakeBuildSpecDB build process for mm-dd .csv download of the
		 territory map raw data from RefUSA creating RU<mhp-name>_mm-dd
		DoSed.sh shell invoked prior to make to edit territory ID and
		 <mhp-name> into MakeUpdateMHPDwnld.tmp and MakeBuildSpecDB.tmp

The primary target for MakeUpdateMHPDwnld is the Mapxxx_RU.csv file.
MapxxRU.csv will be considered out-of-date if the RH<mhp-name>_mm-dd.db
file is newer. MakeUpdateMHPDwnld creates anew the Mapxxx_RU.csv by
querying the RH<mhp-name>_ mm-dd.db for records specific to territory xxx.
It depends upon the Terrxxx_RU.db table Terrxxx_MHP to match up address
fields from RH<mhp-name>_mm-dd.db that belong to that territory.

Once the Mapxxx_RU.csv has been updated, the build process for UpdateRUDwnld
is run to update the actual Terrxxx_RU.db. The previous (now out-of-date)
Terrxxx_RU.db must be preserved prior to invoking the UpdateRUDwnld make
process, since it will delete the original, creating a new Terrxxx_RU.db.
After the UpdateRUDwnld process completes, the Terrxxx_MHP table from
the out-of-date database is copied over into the newly created database.
This preserves the data for the next time MakeUpdateMHP download runs
on a newer RH<mhp-name>_m2-d2.db.

Once the previous Terrxxx_MHP has been restored into the new database,
one more step is required. If there are any addresses in the new _RUPoly
table that are not in the Terrxxx_MHP table, they need to be added. This
needs to be done, since any given RefUSA map query may not have all
addresses within the MHP territory.

The AllUpdateMHPDwnld.sh shell uses the TIDList.txt file in the
UpdateMHPDwnld project as a list of territory IDs on which to run the
MakeUpdateMHPDwnld build. This shell updates all territories for the
MHP with the latest download data.


MakeBuildSpecDB.

	Dependencies.
	
		<MHP-name>.csv download contains all RefUSA download records from
		  RefUSA map for the territory. (If multiple downloads were required
		  due to the 250 record per download limitation, <MHP-name>.csv
		  is the consolidation of all download pieces.)
		BuildSpclDB.sq contains the SQL template for creating the database.
		DoSed.sh is the stream edit shell that updates the make file and
		  the BuildSpcDB.sq to tailor both to the MHP name and download date.

The build process MakeBuildSpecDB has as its primary target
RU<mhp-name>_mm-dd.db. It will be considered out-of-date if 
RU<mhp-name>_mm-dd.csv is newer. The build process will then regenerate
the .db file from the <MHP-name>.csv.


MakeRUMHP.

	Dependencies.
		Terrxxx_RU.db exists and has table Terrxxx_RUPoly from prior 
		  download of RefUSA map for territory xxx.
		DoSed1.sh shell invoked prior to make to edit territory ID and
		 <mhp-name> into MakeRUMHP.tmp and AddMHPTable.sq
	
MakeRUMHP builds the table Terrxxx_MHP into the Terrxxx_RU.db. If a prior
Terrxxx_MHP table exists, it is removed and a new table created. The query
AddMHPTable.sql is edited by DoSed, then run to create a new table and
populate it with the data from the existing Terrxxx_RUPoly records.

If the .db file is rebuilt, the AllMakeUpdateMHPDwnld shell will then
use the TIDList.txt file as a list of all the territories whose
Mapxxx_RU.csv files need to be updated, and update them. It will then
use the same TIDList information to perform a batch update of all the
RefUSA-Downloads/Terrxx/Terrxxx_RU.db files to bring them all up-to-date.

Further, once all the Terrxxx_RU.db files are brought up-to-date,
the same TIDList information will be used to perform a batch run of
BridgesToTerr on all these territories to update their QTerrxxx.ods and
.csv files. Then the user can manually run Calc to regenerate the
actual publisher territories.

A separate MHP RU Downloads table in the SystemTracker spreadsheet keeps
track of the MHP full downloads and updates. (future)This table will then
have a macro assigned that will update the corresponding record for each
territory in the "Territory Master Map" worksheet, so that the master is
kept up-to-date with these changes.


Support Utilities/Shells.
-------------------------
DoSed - shell executed from Build menu to set territory ID and special
  database name in the makefiles, sql, and shell files for building
  this MHP database update.

PreMake - Build menu item to perform make of ExtractOldDiffs and
  IntegrateOldDiffs shells prior to invoking Make. DoSed must be run
  prior to selecting PreMake, since DoSed modifies the SQL for both
  ExtractOldDiffs and IntegrateOldDiffs. This menu item is only visible
  if the user is focused on a file that has a .sh extension.

ExtractOldDiffs - shell script built on-the-fly to extract records from
  previous download (/Previous/Terrxxx_RU.db) where the previous UnitAddress
  was not picked up in the RU download that populated the /Special MHP
  database. This preserves prior UnitAddress records across downloads of
  the MHP, since there is no county data for each address in the MHP.
  RefUSA may, or may not, have a given UnitAddress in its data for
  "unoccupied" properties. For letter coverage of the territories it
  is important to have as complete a list of addresses as possible.

IntegrateOldDiffs - shell script built on-the-fly to integrate previous
  download records obtained by ExtractOldDiffs back into the current
  MHP territory database. This restores addresses that were in the prior
  database, but which were not in the latest MHP download. Restored
  addresses have the "resident" field changed to "?" to indicate that
  the present occupant is unknown to RefUSA, but the address has been
  preserved.

Make - Build menu item to make the Terrxxx_RU.db fresh from the new download
  while preserving previous addresses.

(bashpath)AnySQLtoSQ - shell utility to convert SQL to a series of shell
  'echo' statements creating an SQLTemp.sql when run. This facilitates
  using bash's parameter passing capabilities to morph an SQL query
  on-the-fly to match whatever build is in progress.

Significant Notes.
------------------
The CyclePreviousRU.sh shell in /Procs-Dev recycles the Terrxxx_RU.db
into the Terrxxx/Previous folder. This shell essentially "pushes" the
current Terrxxx_RU.db into Previous so that it can be differenced with
the updated Terrxxx_RU.db created by the UpdateMHPDwnld build. This
operation is essential in order for ExtractOldDiffs and IntegrateOldDiffs
to work properly.
