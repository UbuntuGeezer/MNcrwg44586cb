Project Description.
--------------------
AnySQLtoSH will take any .sql file and transform it into a shell file
.sh by the same filename. To do this 2 transformations take place: the
original .sql file is converted to a sequence of "echo" commands that
will produce a file SQLTemp.sql containing all the SQL from the original
file. This first transformation ends up on target file 'filename.ss'.
Then a second transformation takes the .sq file and adds bash header and
trailing commands to make the .sq file into a complete shell file with
name 'filename.sh'.

The transforms are all performed in a base folder name provided to the
make Build. The Build must be supplied with both the base folder name
and the base filename before it can proceed.

Setup.
------
To convert any SQL to a shell, do the following:

Build Menu: edit the "sed" command line with the path and the .sql
 filename (without the .sql suffix)
 run "sed" from the Build menu to set up the makefile
 run "Make" from the Build menu to create the <filename>.sh

The <filename>.sh is now ready to either run from a command line or
from another shell.
