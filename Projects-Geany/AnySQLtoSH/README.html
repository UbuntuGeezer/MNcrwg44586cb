<h3 id="1.0">Project Description.</h3>

<p>AnySQLtoSH will take any .sql file and transform it into a shell file
.sh by the same filename. To do this 2 transformations take place: the
original .sql file is converted to a sequence of "echo" commands that
will produce a file SQLTemp.sql containing all the SQL from the original
file. This first transformation ends up on target file 'filename.ss'.
Then a second transformation takes the .sq file and adds bash header and
trailing commands to make the .sq file into a complete shell file with
name 'filename.sh'.</p>

<p>The transforms are all performed in a base folder name provided to the
<em>make</em> Build. The Build must be supplied with both the base folder name
and the base filename before it can proceed.</p>

<p>If the file &lt; preamble ><a href="#2.1">[see below]</a> is present in the base folder, it will be considered
a shell preamble to be inserted after the hdrAnySQL_1.sh in the target shell.
This provides for situations where the generated SQL is dependent upon
environment vars that the preamble shell can set up before the SQL is
executed from the target shell.</p>

<p>If postprocessing other than normal shutdown is necessary for the SQL, the project
HdrsSQLtoSH makes provision for both preamble and post-SQL <em>bash</em> processing. See
the <a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/HdrsSQLtoSH/README.html">HrdsSQLtoSH</a> project documentation.

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Setup.</h3>

<p>AnySQLtoSH will use a path and an SQL source file to generate an executable shell
by the same name as the SQL source file, with the .sql suffix replaced with .sh.
The user may also supply a <em>preamble</em> file which contains <em>bash</em> commands that
set up entry conditions for the SQL (e.g. environment vars that point to databsases).
If <em>bash</em> postprocessing is necessary following the SQL execution, use the HdrsSQLtoSH
project instead.</p>

<p>To convert any SQL to a shell, do the following:
<pre><code><a id="2.1"></a>Build Menu: edit the "sed" command line with the path, the .sql
 filename (without the .sql suffix) and optional preamble filename
 run "sed" from the Build menu to set up the makefile
 run "Make" from the Build menu to create the &lt; filename >.sh
</pre></code>
The &lt; filename >.sh is now ready to either run from a command line or
from another shell.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>
