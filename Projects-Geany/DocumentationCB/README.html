<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>The DocumentationCB project contains the information about the 
Chromebook/chromeos-specific Territories system. The Chromeook (CB) system is a
child project cloned from the Linux-host based original system. As with the 
original host system, the Territories system is organized into two segments;
the data segment and the code segment. The data segment contains all of the
congregation territory and publisher territory data. The code segment contains
all of the supporting code for the data segment. Some code of the is resident
within the publisher territory folders, but is still considered to be in the
code segment. </p>

<p>Before reading further, it may be helpful to skip ahead to the section
<a href="#3.0">"Two Ways of Organizing Territories"</a>. This is an overview of the two different
approaches to organizing publisher territories. Afer reading that section
the overall design and implementation of this Territory system will be
much better understood. This document assumes familiarity with the original
host system, but understanding the way the previous system organized territory
data is all that is really necessary.</p>

<p>The data segment remains mostly unchanged from the original host system, except
for adjustmemts to some file paths in code that resides
in the data segment. The code segment is heavily modified from the original
due to constraints imposed by chromeos Linux and limited system-resident
file space.</p>

<p>Specific documentation on the data segment is contained on this link:

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 System Limitations.</h3>

<p><strong>Hardware Limitations.</strong><br>
The Chromebook system only has 32G of on-board "disk" space. Due to this constraint
a large Territories subsystem will consume nearly 75% of the available SDD drive
space. Caution must be exercised when updating with county download data to
avoid overwhelming available space. Also, only the current county download data
should be kept resident on the SDD system. There simply is not enough room for
prior download data to remain on the system.</p>

<p><strong>Software Limitations.</strong><br>
The Chromebook "off-the'shelf" system only has partial "Linux" support. User shell
files are not supported, as they are considered potentially compromising to the
underlying chromeos system. The only way the Territories system can run on the
Chromebook is to place the Chromebook in "developer mode". Note that the Chromebook
documentation states that any software warranties are voided by running in
developer mode.</p>

<p>Developer mode is initiated by entering ctrl-D at system startup when the OS
verification prompt is issued. <strong>WARNING</strong> If the system has not been previously
initialized for developer mode, all files will be wiped from the system before
developer mode is started.</p>

<p>Once developer mode has initialized the Terminal app will allow the user access
to all of the system folders, while adding a "Linux files" file system. Terminal
runs within a "virtual machine" container in the chromeos system. This makes it
a bit tricky to access the Chromebook/MyFiles folders, but it is possible. For
the most part it is sufficient to build and manage the Linux files system for
apps like the Territories system.</p>

<p>The user may use the GNU/Linux tools to install additional packages on the
Chromebook system (e.g. LibreOffice). When such packages are installed, in
order for them to "see" files in the chromeos system, the folder(s) in which
the files reside must be "Linux-shared" through the Files app. A prime
example of this is files that are stored on a removable USB drive. Until
"shared" with the "Linux files" system, the Terminal application, nor
any of the Linux apps, will have access to the USB drive files.</p>

<h4>File and Path Naming Limitations.</h4>

<p>Wherever possible it is wise to avoid filenames and pathnames that contain
spaces (' '). While normal usage provides methods to specify either of these
containing spaces, this type of name provides special challenges when
encountered in shell files or environment variables. </p>

<p>*bash* command processing was not originally intended to support file or
path names with embedded spaces. In the distant past *bash* was modified
to provide a syntactic hook for embedding spaces in these names. Within
a *bash* command line, the escape sequence '\ ' allows bash to leave an
embedded space intact when the command is interpreted. This works fine
for any command line field, but becomes really problematic if the command
is assigning a value to an environment variable. <strong>WARNING</strong> Never use
an escaped space within an environment variable definition (e.g. svar=USB\ Drive).</p>

<p>GNU/Linux apps do not distinguish upper/lower case within file or path names.
While the chromeos file system does distinguish upper/lower case names within
its file system, to GNU/Linux apps like *git* and *tar* do not. Any
GNU/Linux apps that do not make case distinctions will give priority to
the uppercase name and ignore the lowercase name (usually with a warning).</p>

<p><strong>Shell vs. Function Handling.</strong> Wnen it is desired to have a shell that
processes a path containing embedded spaces that also works for paths not
containing embedded spaces, one of the best choices is to implement the shell
both as a ".sh" executable file, and as a function definition within a file
that will be loaded into the Terminal session via the *source* command.
This is especially useful when it would have been desirable to pass the
path containing an embedded space as a shell parameter. In this case, the
".sh" shell can handle all the cases where no embedded space is present.
A separate function definition that mimics the ".sh" shell may be defined
that handles what would have been passed with an embedded space as a special
case.</p>

<p>This provides differentiation for the user by using the same name for the
".sh" file and for the defined function. For example, suppose the shell file
name is "FindFileInTars.sh". The user can define the same named function as
"function FindFileInTars(){". The shell that handles all cases with no embedded
spaces is invoked with "./FindFileInTars.sh p1 p2 etc.", while the function
that handles cases with embedded spaces is invoked with 
"FindFileInTars p1 p2 etc."</p>

<p>The function FindFileInTars in the above example can use most of the code from
the ".sh" file, but modified to handle the embedded space(s). One of the easiest
ways is to use a different parameter list with keyword(s) that will trigger
commands that have the embedded space already present. As noted before, it
will not work to place an escaped embedded space within an environment variable.</p>

<p>All such defined functions may be placed within a single file 
(e.g. functions.sh). To activate the functions for a given Terminal session,
use the command:<pre><code>    source  &lt; file-name ></code></pre>where 
&lt; file-name > is the name of the file containing the function definitions.</p>

<h4> Linux File System Path Hiding.</h4>

<p>The "Linux files" absolute folder paths are not visible to the Chromebook user
interface since they are "containerized". They are visible to Chromebook via
URLs that contain a "file://" definition with the container path. The container
path is of the general form 
"/media/fuse/crostini<em>&lt; 40-character-hash ></em>termina_peguin/&lt; Linux-files-path >".
The easiest way to determine the path to a Linux file is to use the Chromebook
*Files* app to open an existing ".html" file from the "Linux files" folders.
This will open the file in a Chrome web browser tab which, in turn, will have
the full file path in the web browser URL line. The "file://" URL may then be
copied (up to the &lt; Linux-files-path >) and pasted where needed to supply the
"containerized" path to the Linux file.</p>

<p>This technique is most often used when defining hyperlinks to ".html" files
referenced with other ".html" files. It may also be used whenever a Chromebook
app needs to access a "Linux-files" shared file.</p>

<p>Developer mode requirement, Linux file sharing, absolute file path hiding..</p>

<p>Be sure to include notes about the <em>source</em> command behavior when the same function
is defined in more than one .sh shell file. The latest definition takes precedence
when multiple <em>source</em> .sh files are active.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Two Ways of Organizing Territories.</h3>

<p>The two principal ways of organizing publisher territories are "map-based" and
"address-based". The traditional way that territories have been organized is
map-based. Publishers checked out a territory map and worked house-to-house
within the boundaries outlining the territory. Since map-based territories
have been used for years it is assumed that the reader understands that type of
territory organization. This section focuses on address-based territories.</p>

<p>With the increase of apartment complexes and gated communities within
congregation territories has come the need for address-based organization.
Address-based territories are lists of addresses, rather than maps. This type
of organization especially lends itself to letter-writing and telephone
territories.</p>

<p>This Territory system is entirely address-based. The publisher territories it
produces consist of lists of addresses, rather than maps. However, this system
has been implemented to transform map-based territories into address-based
territories by importing the address data contained within a set of map
boundaries. The imported data is then transformed into numbered territories
which correspond exactly to the congregation publisher territory numbers. The
publishers are then given the numbered territory in the form of an address list.</p>

<p><strong>Data Acquisition.</strong><br>
The disadvantage of address-based territories is that the individual address
data is quite cumbersome by comparison to looking at a map. All that a map-based
territory needs is the street names and outer boundaries. Address-based
territories need every individual address within the territory boundaries. To
avoid the need to redefine an entire new set of publisher territories, this
Territory system is set up to acquire data by using online map-based systems and
extracting all addresses within the outlined map area.</p>

<p>The various map-based systems available online typically allow the user to draw
a polygon around a map area, then obtain the address data from within the area
defined by the polygon. The data acquired in this manner is then downloaded from
the host system into a Comma Separated Values (.csv) file on the user's system.</p>

<p><strong>Data Transformation.</strong><br>
Once the data has been downloaded onto the user's system, it can be massaged
into whatever form the user desires. This Territory system moves downloaded
map address data into a format usable for producing publisher territories. For
the purposes of this discussion the portion of the Territory system that handles
the majority of this work is termed the "back-end" software. The portion that
handles the actual territory generation is termed the "front-end" software.</p>

<p>The back-end software moves the data through a series of transformations using
SQL databases and spreadsheets as the data is merged and organized from various
sources. The end result of the back-end software is a .csv file of addresses for
each territory that serves as input for the front-end software.</p>

<p>The front-end software consists of a spreadsheet and supporting macros that take
the .csv data produced by the back-end software and produces the publisher-ready
territory in either spreadsheet or PDF format. There are samples of the
publisher-ready territories; Sample_PubTerr.xls Sample_SuperTerr.xlsx, and
Sample_PubTerr.pdf in the DocumentationCB project folder. In addition the file
AddressLookupInstructions.html is the instructions sheet given to publishers.

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 Chromebook Territories System.</h3>

<p>The Chromebook Territories system, like the <em>origin</em> system, is divided into
two segments. The data segment contains all of the congregation and publisher
territory information stored in a combination of SQL databases, spreadsheets
and supporting files. The code segment contains shell files, SQL queries and
supporting files for importing and managing the territory data, including
generating publisher territories for distribution.</p>

<h3 id="5.0">5.0 Front-end Data.</h3>

<p>Publisher territories are generated by running the ProcessQTerrs12.ods workbook
to process the front-end data for the territory. The front-end data is comprised
of a .csv file where each line is an address record. Each territory has its own
file of front-end data. The filename for any given territory's front-end data is
QTerrxxx.csv, where 'xxx' is the territory number.</p>

<p>The Territories file system is organized with the downstream folder /TerrData as
the parent folder for all publisher territories. Under that parent folder are
separate folders, one per territory, that contain the publisher territory files.
Each territory has 3 files that are distributed for publisher use: Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx,
Terrxxx_SuperTerr.xlsx, and Terrxxx_PubTerr.pdf. These three files are all
produced from the front-end data by the ProcessQTerrs.ods spreadsheet and
associated macros.</p>

<p>The front-end data for any given territory is obtained from the Working-Files
folder in the TerrData/Terrxxx folder. The file containing the data is
named QTerrxxx.csv for territory 'xxx'. As long as the fields in each .csv
record are in the correct order with the correct data, the publisher territory
can be successfully generated. Following is a comma-separated list of the record
fields in order:
<pre><code>OwningParcel, UnitAddress, Unit, Resident1, Phone1, Homestead,
RefUSA-Phone, Subterritory, Territory, DoNotCall, RSO, Foreign, RecordDate,
SitusAddress, PropUse, DelPending
