<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Territory Code.</h3>

<p>The Territories system code is termed the "code segment". It consists of shell
files, SQL queries, Basic spreadsheet macros and Make files for building and maintaining
the Territories system. Much of the code segment is organized into *geany*
projects for maintenance and use. Some of the code segment is distributed into
the Territory raw data folders, mostly for correcting publisher territory-specific
download anomalies.

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Dependencies.</h3>

<p>Environment variables serve as pointers to the data segment file folders which
are processed by various pieces of code. Following are the principal environment
variables:<pre><code>    folderbase = base folder for the Territories system
    pathbase = path to base folder for the congregation territory files
    codebase = path to the base folder for the code segment files
    congterr = 10+ character congregation territory identifier
    rupath = path to RefUSA raw territory data
    scpath = path to SCPA raw territory data
    U_DISK = path to the base folder for removable USB drives 
    system_log = path to the system log file
    TODAY = date stamp for new database records</code></pre>
In addition to the environment variables, the following folders are defined
on the <em>codebase</em> path:<pre><code>    Procs-Dev = folder for Territories system shell files
    Projects-Geany = *geany* projects base folder
    Projects-Geany/ArchivingBackups = project folder for archiving Territories files</code></pre>

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Code Segment Organization.</h3>

<p>The code segment is primarily organized into projects within the <em>codebase</em>
folders. This section documents the major groupings of source code. In the
following discussion, RefUSA refers to Reference USA territory data, while
SCPA refers to Sarasota County territory data. Each territory data format is
unique enough to require its own code segment processes. As a general rule,
any project within the Projects-Geany folders that contains "RU" as part of
its name has code that manages RefUSA data; any project within the
Projects-Geany folders that contains "SC" as part of its name has the code that
manages SCPA data. Many of the projects within the Projects-Geany folders are
utility projects that are utilized by either the "RU" or "SC" projects.
"SC" as part of its name

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 GitHub Code Tracking.</h3>

<p>GitHub and its associated utility *git* are used for tracking all changes to
the code segment that is not intermixed with the publisher territory data files.
(Code segment files that are intermingled with the publisher territory data
files are not tracked, but historically archived by utilities within the
ArchivingBackups project).</p>

<p>The GitHub project for code segment tracking is <em>TerritoriesCB</em>. The project
source code is all contained under the folder ~/GitHub/TerritoriesCB. All
folders under this main folder are part of the TerritoriesCB project. The
<em>codebase</em> environment variable points to the this GitHub path.</p>

<p>This GitHub project repository is a clone of the repository on the <em>github.com</em>
website. <em>UbuntuGeezer</em> is the owner of this repository on the website. This
repository is password-protected with an expiring password saved in the GitHub
root directory. *git* utility operations that reference the <em>github.com</em>-resident
repository must supply the current password for remote access.</p>

<p>The TerritoriesCB repository has two branches; master - the original code from
the initial development system, Chromebook - the code segment that is specific
to the Chromebook system. From the Chromebook system all changes are made in
the Chromebook branch. This prevents changes specific to the Chromebook from
corrupting the original master code segment (generic to GNU/Ubuntu).</p>

<p>The TerritoriesCB repository has the potential to be organized for different
release levels of code. Currently there are no other systems on which the 
Territories system is installed, so release tracking is not necessary. This may
become a need in the future.
