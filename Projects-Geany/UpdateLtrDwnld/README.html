<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>UpdateLtrDwnld only updates letter-writing territories. Since letter-writing
territories may have addresses scattered throughout the congregation's assigned
territory, it is not possible to consistently try to map them with polygons of
RefUSA data. Instead, each letter-writing terrirtory must be a special territory
which obtains its records from /Special/&lt; spec-db >.db,s. Hence, there is no
Mapxxx_RU.csv polygon download data.</p>

<p>Each letter-writing territory has the SQL query file RegenSpecDB.sql that extracts
the records from the /Special/&lt; spec-db >.db,s containing records for that
territory. The first database built in the RefUSA-Download/Terrxxx folder
is Spec_RU.db.</p>

<p>The Terrxxx_RU.db is built from the Spec_RU.db records using the SQL query
SyncTerrToSpec.sql. That SQL copies all of the Bridge records from the Specxxx_RU.db
into the Terrxxx_RU.db. Any previous records within the Terrxxx_RU.db are
abandoned, so the only records will be the newest records from the
/Special/&lt; db-name >.db,s.
