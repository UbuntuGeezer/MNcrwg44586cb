<h2>Project Description.</h2>

<p>The TerrPageHeader project facilitates adding page header information to
the publisher territory sheets. This feature will place page headings on 
each page when a spreadsheet is printed. The page headings will contain
the territory area name, zip code and column headings for readability.</p>

<h2>Method.</h2>

<p>TerrPageHeader creates a shell file within its project folder that
can take a given territory and add header information to its spreadsheet.
First pass will be to create 3 .ods workbooks, one for each zip code within
the territory. This appears easier than automating the UNO interface to
jump into the Headers and Footers frame.</p>

<p>The appropriate header worksheet (by zip code) will be copied to a new
workbook. Then all the rows from the publisher territory will be copied
into the workboook. The original publisher territory workbook will be saved
under the new name Terrxxx<em>PubTerr</em>.xlsx. Then the new workbook will be
saved under the original name Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx.</p>

<h2>Dependencies.</h2>

<p>PageHdr34285.ods - empty sheet with page header for zip code 34285.</p>

<p>PageHdr34292.ods - empty sheet with page header for zip code 34292.</p>

<p>PageHdr34275.ods - empty sheet with page header for zip code 34275.</p>

<p>AddPubTerrHdr.ods - Spreadsheet with internal macros to add header to
 territory spreadsheet. All runs are considered "batch" runs using the
 first sheet in the workbook as a list of territories for which to add
 headers to Terrxxx<em>SuperTerr.xlsx, Terrxxx</em>PubTerr.xlsx, and
 Terrxxx_PubTerr.pdf.</p>

<h2>Significant Notes.</h2>

<p>TerrPageHeader was initially implemented under Libre Office 6.4.6. When
the ChromeBook computer was obtained, the chromeos installed Libre Office
7.2.4. AddPubTerrHdr.ods macros would hang when attempting to load and
copy the zip code header .ods into the territory sheet. Upon investigation
the "Headers and Footers" menu item under "Insert" was visible, but disabled.</p>

<p>Version 7.2.4 was then uninstalled and the .deb for version 7.1.7.2 was
downloaded and installed. The "Headers and Footers" menu item is enabled
in this version. Hopefully this resolves the AddPubTerrHdr.ods macro
hanging issue.</p>

<p>There is a mysterious issue with AddPubTerrHdr.ods processing of territories.
Sometimes the <em>run</em> hangs, apparently waiting for input, but without a prompt
window being displayed. The situation seems to be improved by making sure that
the calc <em>Window</em> menu item focus matches the shortcut bar <em>Calc</em> Window dropdown,
but it does not always resolve the issue. When the hang happens do the following:</p>

<pre><code>     Enter/start a Terminal session

    enter the *psfind* shortcut; this will start the PSFIND utility that will
     allow searching the active jobs in the system

    press the "enter" key at the first prompt

    at the ":" prompt type "/calc"

    when the displayed jobs list appears make note of the session ID of the
     job immediately preceding the *psfind* job (e.g. 21984)

    type "Q" to exit psfind

    enter the command "kill <jobid>" at the Terminal command prompt; this will
     kill the hung calc session

    Use the session control with the time displayed at the lower right corner of
     the applications window by clicking on the *time*, then select *sign out*
     from the session control window to sigh out

    log back in when the *login* prompts appear and select *recover apps*

    restart calc and allow calc *recovery* to recover the files

    close the PageHdr342xx.ods file window

    attempt to rerun the AddPubTerrHdr.Main1 function
