Build Description.
------------------
The main target of this build is Terrxxx_SC.db, where xxx is the
SC data for territory xxx.

Its prerequisites are all in the folder ~/SCPA/SCPA-Downloads/Terrxxx
where xxx is the territory ID.  This process will bring the Bridge
SCPA territory records up-to-date with the download of month mm, day dd.
The prerequisite files are:
	UpdtyyyM.csv - changed records for MultiMail.db this territory
	UpdtyyyP.csv - changed records for PolyTerri.db this territory
	FixyyySC.sh - SC postprocess fixes shell for this territory
	FixyyySC.sql - SC postprocess fixes sql for this territory

Terrxxx_SC.db will be considered out-or date if changes to either the
postprocess shell, or its internal .sql query are newer than
Terrxxx_SC.db. This is so that, even if the download data is current,
if there is a change to the postprocess, the SC Bridge records will be
checked and updated if necessary.
