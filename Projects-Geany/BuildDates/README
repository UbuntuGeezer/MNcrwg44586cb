Project Description.
--------------------
BuildDates does a full listing of the TerrData/Terrxxx/Terrxxx_PubTerr.xlsx
subdirectories and files, then uses awk/mawk to extract the filenames and
dates to TerrData/BuildDates.csv. The BuildDates.csv file, or BuildDates.xlsx 
(created by Calc) should accompany any territory tarballs sent to various
locations so that the files do not need to be extracted in order to see the
various territory generation dates.

Setup.
------
BuildDates is stand-alone.

BuildDates Build Menu:

	run 'Make' to create/update the TerrData/BuildDates.csv file for export.
