<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>
BridgesToTerr takes the Bridge data from both the RU and SC territory
databases, copies the records into the appropriate territory generation
source databases PolyTerri.db and MultiMail.db, then queries those
databases to a .csv for use by Calc in generating publisher territory.

Bridge data records contain a RecordType field that identifies which
master publisher territory the bridge record gets placed in. Type "R" will be
placed in PolyTerri.db; type M will be placed in MultiMail.db, type "U" will
be placed in PolyTerri.db. Type "U" records have a CongTerrID field that is
reserved for "unassigned" territories. Unassigned territories contain parcels
that have not yet been assigned to territories. These parcels are typically
within new gated communities.

This project is a bit unconventional in that, unlike other projects, the
primary target of the build is phony. All of the results of this build
are side-effects, that will be used in generating territories.
<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Dependencies.</h3>
**NOTE:** A .PHONY target is always considered out-of-date, regardless of the
state of the file system. (e.g. all, install, clean, distclean, TAGS, info
check). Generally, all targets in your makefile which to not produce an
output file by the same name should be declared PHONY.
A target with no dependencies will always be built.

Most of the project dependencies are shell files that were invoked
individually prior to defining the makefile for this project.
<pre><code>MakeBridgesToTerr.tmp - template for MakeBridgesToTerr makefile to build
   from the Bridges in databases to a territory table, then ultimately
   to a .csv file for use by Calc in generating the publisher territory.

DoSed.sh - sed preprocessor to edit territory ID into MakeBridgesToTerr.

TIDList.txt - [optional] list of territory IDs for repeated calls to
   process multiple territories from their Bridge tables to .csv files
   to generate publisher territories.

AddLetterZips.sh - shell to add zip codes to UnitAddress fields in the
   Terrxxx_SC.db.Terrxxx_SCBridge records for letter territories (6xx)
   invoked by MakeBridgesToTerr makefile.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Procs-Dev Shells.</strong></p>

<pre><code>ClearTerr.sh - shell to clear all territory records from PolyTerri and
   MultiMail for fresh generation of records.

CombineBridgeNames.sh - shell to combine all owner names from SCPA county
   data into comma separated field for publisher territory.

SetSCRUdncs.sh - set donotcall fields in territory records.

NewRUSCTerrToDBs - move RU and SC territory records from territory Bridge
   tables into PolyTerri and MultiMail dbs.

QGetTerr.sh - extract territory records from PolyTerri and MultiMail into
   QTerrxxx.db for publisher territory generation.

SortQTerrByAddr.sh - sort QTerrxxx.db records by address, using house/bldg
   number as integer to assure correct ordering by Calc.

QGenTable.sh - generate table.csv records for import into Calc for 
   generating territory.

Project Shells.
CopyPubNotes.sh - copy PUB_NOTES_xxx.html to TerrData/Terrxxx if exists.

LastChanceDNCs.sh - redo DNC fields in QTerrxxx.db to ensure no DNCs missed.

LastChanceDNCs.sq - SQL query built into .sh shell for setting DNC fields.

Other Projects Dependencies.
MakeBridgesToTerr uses other projects in processing.

MakeAnySQLtoSH - project to take any SQL file and convert it to a series
   of shell commands, generating SQLTemp.sql for sqlite.

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Setup.</h3>
Before running the Build for BridgesToTerr, ensure that the Terrxxx_SC.db
and Terrxxx_RU.db Bridge tables are up-to-date. (See the projects UpdateSCBridge
UpdateRUDwnld, UpdateRUSpecial,  and UpdtRULetter.)
<pre><code>BridgesToTerr Build menu:

    'sed' menu item; edit the territory ID to process into the DoSed command
    run 'sed' from the Build menu

    [run 'Make dry-run' from the Build Menu to check Build process setup.]

    run 'Make' from the Build menu to update the PolyTerri and MultiMail
     territory master dbs and generate the TerrData/Working-Files used
     by Calc in generating the Terrxxx_PubTerr files.
</code></pre>

<p>When the BridgesToTerr build completes, if the TerrxxxHdr.ods file has 
not yet been generated in the TerrData/Working-Files folder, a reminder
message is issued to run Calc to generate the header file for the territory.</p>

<p>The territory records for territory xxx are now ready for production into
the publisher territory files. A "one-stop-shopping" spreadsheet in the
DoTerrsWithCalc project folder is what actually builds the publisher
territory files. This workhorse spreadsheet is ProcessQTerrs12.ods. (See
the DoTerrsWithCalc project README file for instructions.)</p>

<p><strong>Note.</strong>
If a PUB_NOTES_xxx.html file exists for a territory in its RefUSA-Downloads
folder, it will be copied to the folder TerrData/Terrxxx folder for release
with the publisher territory.<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 Batch Setup.</h3>

<p>BridgesToTerr has been set up to support batch runs for multiple territories.
The shell AllBridgesToTerr.sh does the batch runs. The project file 
TIDList.txt supplies AllBridgesToTerr with the list of territories to
process.</p>

<p>Note. Linux-based systems have a command-line utility 'seq' that can
produce a list of numbers in sequence and output it to a file. The command
is:</p>

<pre><code>
   seq  <first> <last> [<interval>]
where <first> = first number in sequence
      <last> = last number in sequence
      <interval> = (optional) interval between numbers; default 1
</code></pre>

<p>BridgesToTerr Project folder:</p>

<pre><code>
    edit the TIDList.txt file entering all of the territory IDs to
     be processed, one per line. A line beginning with '#' is treated
     as a comment, and will be ignored.
    (MakeGetIDList is a makefile that may be used to build the TIDList.txt
     file of all territories that have "diffs" records pending from the latest
     SC download).
</code></pre>

<pre><code> (see note in BuildSCDiff/README.md about query to run to generate a TIDList
 specific to the territories that require updating due to a new SCPA download.)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_67db2e155275fc7e48975519462d5b22a040848a_termina_penguin/GitHub/TerritoriesCB/Projects-Geany/BuildSCDiff/README.html#4.0">BuildSCDiff</a><br> <br />
BridgesToTerr Build menu:</p>

<pre><code>
    set the Geany editor focus on any text file (e.g. README, TIDList.txt).
     This will expose the 'Batch Run' Build menu item.

    run the 'Batch Run' Build menu item. This will process the territory
     Bridge files into the PolyTerri and MultiMail territory master dbs
     and extract the records into the TerrData/Terrxxx/Working-Files folder
     that will be used by Calc in territory generation.
</code></pre>   

<p>The territory records for all of the territories listed in the TIDList.txt
file are now ready for production intothe publisher territory files. As
with the individual territory build, use the ProcessQTerrs12.ods spreadsheet
to build the territory files. The TIDList.txt file can be opened in the
ProcessQTerrs12.ods spreadsheet and copied to a sheet which contains the
list of territories to process. (See the DoTerrsWithCalc project README file
for instructions.)<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="5.0">5.0 Significant Notes.</h3>

<p><strong>Chromebook/chromeos.</strong></p>

<p>Chromebook/chromeos running in developer mode supports the linux infrastructure.
For this project (and others) Territories.xba has been modified with three
module-wide constants for correct pathing during runtime. These constants
replace hard-coded strings within the code so that the code library can be
migrated to different host systems.</p>

<p>The constants for Chromebooks/chromeos are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
  csTerrBase = "/home/vncwmk3"          '// $HOME env var value on Chromebook
  csTerrDataPath = "/home/vncwmk3/Territories/TerrData" '// TerrData folder path
</code></pre>

<p>For the flashdrive-based ubuntu they are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
  csTerrBase = "/media/ubuntu/Windows/Users/Bill"
  csTerrDataPath = /media/ubunut/Windows/Users/Bill/Territories/TerrData"
</code></pre>
