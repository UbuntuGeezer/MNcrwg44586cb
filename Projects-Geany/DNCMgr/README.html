<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>DoNotCalls (DNCs) are closely managed for the congregation territory. They fall into
three categories: householder requested, registered sex offender, or foreign language.
Householder requested DNCs are addresses where the householder has requested not
to be visited. Registered sex offender DNCs are addresses where a registered sex
offender is domiciled. Foreign language DNCs are addresses that are being worked by
a foreign language congregation.</p>

<p>The DNCMgr manages adding, deleting, and archiving DoNotCalls. Whenever
the TerrIDData.DoNotCalls table has a record deleted or changed (including add),
the DNCUpdt trigger is activated. This trigger adds a log message to the DNCLog
table with the timestamp of when the table was changed. Brief descriptions of each
operation follow:</p>

<pre><code>
    Capture - captures the DNCs from /Territory-PDFs/all_dncs_report.pdf
    Add - adds a new record to the TerrIDData.DoNotCalls table.
    Delete - deletes a record from the TerrIDData.DoNotCalls table and adds it to
        the DeletedDNCs table.
    Archive - copies a record from the TerriData.DoNotCalls table and adds it to
        the ArchivedDNCs table; then it deletes the record from the DoNotCalls table.
    (Move - moves a DNC record from one territory to another; this is a combination
        of Archive, Delete, and Recover operations.)
    Recover - recover a DNC record from the ArchivedDNCs table back into the DoNotCalls
        table, resetting the territory id from the old id to the recovery ID.
</code></pre>

<p>Operations by the DNCMgr are secured and tracked by Login and Logout shells within the
DNC. Before embarking on any DNCMgr operations use Login.sh to set the initials of the
administrator that is using the DNCMgr. When operations are complete, use Logout.sh to
log the adminitrator out. If there is no active administrator logged in, DNCMgr
operations will exit with an error message.</p>

<pre><code>
change to the DNCMgr project folder then:
    . ./Login.sh    < initials >
    . ./Logout.sh   < initials >
where < initials > are the admiinistrator's initials.
</code></pre>Note: It is important to use the leading "." before invoking the
Login/Logout shells. These shells leave behind the environment variable \*adminwho
that has the initials of the current logged-in administrator.

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Capturing DoNotCalls.</h3>
Capturing DoNotCalls takes the all\_donotcalls\_report.pdf and migrates it through
a series of conversions into a .csv which may then be used as input to other operations.
<br><a href="#IX">Index</a>
<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Adding New DoNotCalls.</h3>
DoNotCalls are added by creating one or more records in the file AddDNC.csv.
Each record in the AddDNC.csv file will be imported as a new record into the
DoNotCalls table in TerrIDData.db. One may either use a spreadsheet and save
the sheet as AddDNC.csv, or use a text editor to enter the new DNC record(s).
A template file NewDNC.tmp within the project provides the field names for
each record. The NewDNC.csv file is assumed to have no header row.

Adding DoNotCalls that are registered sex offenders requires special handling.
The DoNotCall records within TerrIDData have an RSO field which is a registered
sex offender id field linked to the RSOAddress table. See the section
[Registered Sex Offenders]
below for details on adding registered sex offenders.

To Add new DoNotCalls run \*make on MakeAddDNC. This will build the AddDNC.sh
shell. Then run the AddDNC.sh shell. This fires up LibreOffice/Calc on the template
NewDNC.tmp.csv which serves as a template for adding new DoNotCalls.
<pre><code>
    make -f MakeAddDNC
    ./AddDNC.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Following are brief descriptions of the columns to be entered in the NewDNC
spreadsheet: (*'d fields are mandatory)</p>

<pre><code>
    TerrID* - territory ID (3-digit number)
    Name - householder name
    UnitAddress* - street address
    Unit - unit (must be specified if address has units)
    Phone - phone number
    Notes - publisher/service overseer notes
    RecDate - date of DoNotCall yyyy-mm-dd format (e.g. 2023-06-01)
    RSO - = 1 if registered sex offender, 0 or empty otherwise
    Foreign = 1 if foreign language, 0 or empty otherwise (also set LangID below)
    PropID* - 10-digit property ID (obtained from county records) <a href="#GetAddrPID">(see GetAddrPID below)</a>
    ZipCode - zip code of address
    DelPending - deletion pending flag, leave empty (set by system)
    DelDate - deletion date, leave empty (set by system)
    Initials* - initials of person authorizing/making entry
    LangID - foreign language ID, 1=Spanish, 2=Polish, 3=Russian, 4=ASL
</code></pre>

<p>Edit rows into the NewDNC.tmp.csv, then save it to file NewDNC.csv. As a
final step, delete the first two rows (instructions and header) and re-save the
file. The makefile will continue by running the AddDNC.sh shell which imports
the .csv records into the TerrIDData.DoNotCalls table.</p>

<p><a id="GetAddrPID"></a><strong>GetAddrPID</strong><br>
The new DoNotCall records should contain the property IDs of the addresses which
are being added. A utility shell, GetAddrPID.sh, facilitates getting the
property ID of any address/unit.</p>

<pre><code>
    ./GetAddrPID.sh < unitaddress > < unit> 
    where < unitaddress > and < unit > may be SQL "LIKE" matching strings
    (e.g. "130 %VENICE ave%")
</code></pre>

<p><br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 Deleting DoNotCalls.</h3>

<p>Deleting DoNotCalls is intended only for cases where due to a new tenant or
owner, the current DoNotCall for that address is no longer valid. Whenver a
DoNotCall is deleted, a log message is recorded and the record deleted is
copied to the DeletedDNCs table within TerrIDData. The initials of the person
deleting the DoNotCall are included in the record for auditing purposes.</p>

<pre><code>
    ./DoSedDelete.sh  < propid > < unit > < initials>
    make -f MakeDeleteDNC
    ./DeleteDNC.sh
</code></pre>

<p><br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="5.0">5.0 Archiving DoNotCalls.</h3>

<p>If a terrritory is deleted because of no longer being used, its DoNotCalls must
be preserved in the system. Whatever territory(ies) have absorbed the addresses
in the deleted territory must be able to pick up the DoNotCalls from the deleted
territory. The archiving process takes all of the DoNotCalls for a given territory
ID and places them in the ArchivedDNCs table.</p>

<pre><code>
    DoSedArchive.sh < terrid > <initials>
    make -f MakeArchiveDNCs
    ./ArchiveDNCs.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Once stored in the ArchivedDNCs table, the Recover operation can access the
records within the ArchivedDNCs table and recover the DoNotCalls for the
addresses within the target territory that were formerly in the deleted territory.
<br><a href="#IX">Index</a></p>

<h3 id="6.0">6.0 Recovering DoNotCalls.</h3>

<p>When a new territory is created that absorbs some, or all, of a former territory
it must be able to also absorb the DoNotCalls that were in the former territory.
The Recover operation allows a territory to recover the DoNotCalls from the
ArchivedDoNotCalls table using the former territory's territory ID.</p>

<pre><code>
    DoSedRecover.sh  < propertyid > < unit > < initials >
    make -f MakeRecover.sh
    ./RecoverDNC.sh

 < propertyid > = 10-digit property ID
 < unit > = unit or " " if no unit (must be specified)
 < initials > = initials of person authorizing or doing recovery
</code></pre>

<p>To ensure absolute accuracy, the property ID and unit must be an exact match
when recovering a DoNotCall. The current territory records are used
record-by-record to search the ArchivedDNCs table. If a match is found (regardless
of which territory the DoNotCall originally belonged to), the DoNotCall is
recovered by adding it back into the DoNotCalls table with the current territory
ID. The Archived record is then flagged for deletion.</p>

<p>The Recover operation requires the user to enter their initials to provide
an audit trail in the ArchLog table of log entries.
<br><a href="#IX">Index</a><h3 id="7.0">7.0 Registered Sex Offenders.</h3>
Registered sex offenders (RSO) are a special case DoNotCall. A list of
registered sex offenders can be obained by using the following website:
<a href="https://www.offenderradar.com/offender/state-florida-county-sarasota">Registered Sex Offenders</a></p>

<p>All operations involving RSOs are tracked in a separate audit trail, the RSOLog
table. The three operations performed on RSOs are Add, Delete, and Move.</p>

<p>The Add operation adds a new RSO into the RSO tables and the DoNotCalls table.
The Delete operation removes an RSO from the RSO tables. A full Delete will
also remove the address from the DoNotCalls table. A partial delete will leave
the DoNotCalls address active, but without the RSO link. The Move operation
is used when an RSO changes addresses, but remains within the congregation
territory.</p>

<p><strong>Adding RSOs</strong><br>
Adding an RSO is a three-step process. A new DoNotCall entry is created, then
the RSO data is stored in two additional tables within the TerrIDData.db The
information needed to add a new RSO is:</p>

<pre><code>
    Name (full name of the RSO from county/state data)
    Address (street address, unit, zip code)
    Date entered into Territory system
    Notes (usually "SOSC")
</code></pre>

<p>The RSOAddress table provides a master list of property IDs and units where 
registered sex offenders reside within the congregation territory. New entries
in both the RSOAddress and DoNotCalls tables are made by the Add RSO operation.</p>

<p>All RSOInfo table entries are referenced back to the RSOAddress table. When a
new sex offender is added into the RSOAddress table, they are assigned a unique
ID (RSOid). This RSOid is then entered into the new DoNotCalls record in the
RSO field. As long as that sex offender resides within the congregation
territory, they are referenced by that RSOid.</p>

<p>A second table, RSOInfo, contains the details about the sex offender.  The
RSOAddress table is a parent table for both the RSOInfo and DoNotCalls
tables. The RSOid is the FOREIGN key referenced by these two tables. If an
RSOid is changed, the changed ID cascades into both child tables. If an
RSOid is deleted, the child tables set 0 as the RSO value.</p>

<p>The new DoNotCall entry is referenced back to the RSOAddress table by storing
the new RSOid in the RSO field of the DNC entry. In this way, if the sex offender
moves out of the territory, the DoNotCall entry may be deleted.</p>

<p>To create a new RSO in the territory system perform the following steps:</p>

<pre><code>
    Using the NewRSO.tmp template in the project, enter the information for
     the new RSO into the fields and save the file as NewRSO.csv. Not that
     the field delimiters are "|".

    Run AddRSO.sh from within the DNCMgr project. This will make the new RSO
     and DoNotCall entries. 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Deleting RSOs</strong><br>
An RSO is deleted when they move out of the congregation territory. This is
determined by regularly checking the list of Registered Sex Offenders (link
above). The Delete operation removes the entries from the RSOAddress and
RSOInfo tables. If a "full" delete is performed, the DoNotCall record is also
removed. Otherwise the RSO link is set to 0 in the DoNotCall record and it
remains. The RSOid that was assigned is deactivated and will not be re-used.</p>

<p>In most cases, a full delete is what is desired so that is default. If only
a paritial delete is desired, the "-p" parameter on the Delete operation will
preserve the DoNotCall, but not as a registered sex offender.</p>

<p><strong>Moving RSOs</strong><br>
The Move operation handles change-of-address for an RSO within the congregation
territory. The RSO retains their RSOid, but the RSOAddress and RSOInfo table
information is udpated with the new address. The existing DoNotCall record for
the old address is deleted, and a new DoNotCall record for the new address is
created.</p>

<p>Whenever an RSO is moved, its territory ID is set to '000' in its record. Also,
if the new address and unit do not have an exact match in the county data, the
property ID will be set to '9999999999'. The database administrator will have
to set these fields to their proper values. The GetAddrPID shell may be used
to find the property ID for the address. The WhichTerr? shell may be used to
find the territory ID for the address.</p>

<p><strong>RSO Log Entries</strong><br>
The RSOLog table entries are the "log" of RSO operations. Each entry consists of
a timestamp, description of the operation, and the initials of the administrator
that performed the operation. The DumpRSOLog shell lists all the RSOLog entries.
