Project Description.
--------------------
The AddNVenAllRecord project adds a new record (likely missing/omitted
from all previous SC downloads) to the VeniceNTerritory.db table NVenAll.
The user must supply the property ID of the record to add, and the SC
download month and day from which to add the record.

The NVenAll table has as the primary key the property id (Account #), so
the new record will only be added if there is no conflict with existing
records. The entire record from SCPA_mm-dd.db will be added.

In addition, the new property ID will be added to the NVenAccts table so
that it is seen by queries using that table.
