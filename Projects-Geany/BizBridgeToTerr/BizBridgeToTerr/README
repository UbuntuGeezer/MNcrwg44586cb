Project Description.
--------------------
BizBridgeToTerr takes the Bridge data from the RU download business
database and selects all the Bridge table records into a .csv for use by
Calc in generating a business territory.

This project is a bit unconventional in that, unlike other projects, the
primary target of the build is phony. All of the results of this build
are side-effects, that will be used in generating territories.


Dependencies.
-------------
Most of the project dependencies are shell files that were invoked
individually prior to defining the makefile for this project.

MakeBizBridgeToTerr.tmp - template for MakeBizBridgeToTerr makefile to build
   from the Bridges in databases to a territory table, then ultimately
   to a .csv file for use by Calc in generating the publisher territory.

DoSed.sh - sed preprocessor to edit territory ID into MakeBizBridgeToTerr.

TIDList.txt - [optional] list of territory IDs for repeated calls to
   process multiple territories from their Bridge tables to .csv files
   to generate publisher territories.

Procs-Dev Shells.
ClearTerr.sh - shell to clear all territory records from PolyTerri and
   MultiMail for fresh generation of records.

CombineBridgeNames.sh - shell to combine all owner names from SCPA county
   data into comma separated field for publisher territory.

SetSCRUdncs.sh - set donotcall fields in territory records.

NewRUSCTerrToDBs - move RU and SC territory records from territory Bridge
   tables into PolyTerri and MultiMail dbs.

QGetTerr.sh - extract territory records from PolyTerri and MultiMail into
   QTerrxxx.db for publisher territory generation.

SortQTerrByAddr.sh - sort QTerrxxx.db records by address, using house/bldg
   number as integer to assure correct ordering by Calc.

QGenTable.sh - generate table.csv records for import into Calc for 
   generating territory.

Project Shells.
LastChanceDNCs.sh - redo DNC fields in QTerrxxx.db to ensure no DNCs missed.

LastChanceDNCs.sq - SQL query built into .sh shell for setting DNC fields.

Other Projects Dependencies.
MakeBizBridgeToTerr uses other projects in processing.

MakeAnySQLtoSH - project to take any SQL file and convert it to a series
   of shell commands, generating SQLTemp.sql for sqlite.


Setup.
------
Ensure that file Mapxxx_RU.csv exists in BTerrData/BRefUSA/BRefUSA-Downloads/Terrxxx
 folder and is a RefUSA business polygon download.
 
 Build Menu: "sed" command, edit the territory ID in the command line
	run "sed" Build menu item to set up MakeBizBridgeToTerr makefile
	run "Make Dry Run" Build menu item to dry-run the make process
	run "Make" Build menu item to generate the QBTerrxxx.csv file for
	 input to ProcessBQTerrs.ods Calc workbook

At this point, LibreOffice/Calc is used to generate the actual business
territory from the .csv file generated above.
